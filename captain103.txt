On November 15 Graf Spee took the tiny British tanker Africa Star (700-tons) by surprise, capturing her before a distress call could be sent. The captain, P.

To confuse any ships that may have stumbled upon him in such a vulnerable state, Langsdorff ordered a second forward turret and second funnel constructed out of wood and canvas, radically altering the silhouette of his vessel to resemble HMS Renown. </span></span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt;\">\n</div>\n<br />\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt;\">\n<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Capt Langsdorff decided that his ship and crew were about ready to go home. Having sailed over 30,000 miles, Graf Spee's engines were in need of more repairs than could be made at sea. Langsdorff decided to make one more sweep of South America to disrupt trade along the coast to the UK, and then head back to Germany for a well-deserved overhaul for his ship and R&amp;R for his crew. He would first hunt the Cape - UK trade route unitl December 6, and once the enemy was aware of his presence he would take his ship to the River Plate area for a final sweep against beef and wheat from Argentina, and head for Germany with the New Year. </span></span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt;\">\n<br /></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt;\">\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-igFmQrM5Ehs/VQGvNk01iZI/AAAAAAAA2Fw/490FSqA6g6k/s1600/300px-8MWaguila_frente01.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-igFmQrM5Ehs/VQGvNk01iZI/AAAAAAAA2Fw/490FSqA6g6k/s1600/300px-8MWaguila_frente01.jpg\" height=\"337\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>\n<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><span style=\"color: black;\"><br /></span></span>\n<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Refueling and provisioning from Altmark on November 26, Langsdorff decided to redistribute his prisoners. Captains and first officers would return to Germany on Graf Spee, while Altmark would land the rest at a neutral port. Ironically, Langsdorff wrote that because Graf Spee's period of commerce raiding was nearing the end, it was no longer absolutely necessary to avoid action with enemy warships. Should an enemy warship sight and attempt to follow Graf Spee, he would close the range and use his ship's powerful guns to at least damage it so as to eliminate the threat of a shadowing warship calling in reinforcements. <br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\" /> <br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\" /> </span></span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt;\">\n<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"color: #3b491f; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Graf Spee made her presence known off Africa on December 2. The liner Doric Star (10,100-tons) was sighted bound for Britain from New Zealand with mutton, butter, cheese, and wool. This liner too sent a distress message despite being warned not to do so. This properly stirred up a hornet's nest in the area, and the Germans planned to put a prize crew on the liner for later use as a supply ship before dashing across the Atlantic.&nbsp;</span></span><br />\n<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"color: #3b491f; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><span style=\"color: black;\"><br /></span></span>\n<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"color: #3b491f; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">But just as German seamen boarded this valuable prize with her rich cargo, Graf Spee's seaplane ran out of fuel and had to make a forced landing.

Tairoa's captain Star had gotten off a distress signal before is radio room was wrecked by gunfire. <span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>Langsdorff could have killed all the captains who disobeyed him . On December 6, Graf Spee met up with Altmark again. After exchanging prisoners for fuel and provisions, Graf Spee headed westward to the River Plate area. Captains Star and Brown (Huntsman) were also transferred to Altmark, so that they might look after the captive crewmen.<br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\" /> <br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\" /> </span></span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt;\">\n<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"color: #3b491f; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">On the evening of December 7, Graf Spee sighted the freighter SS Streonhalh (4000-tons) bound for Britain from Montevideo.

But the Arado 196 <span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>plane suffered another in a series of cracked engine cylinders, due to design fault of splashing cold sea water while landing, and Graf Spee was fresh out of spares, so Langsdorff would no longer have the benefit of his eyes in the sky. <br />\n<br />\nDecember 13, Graf Spee reached the point 300 miles from Montevideo where she expected to find her final four victims. The lack of aerial recognizance caused Graf Spee's luck to run out: dawn broke, but no merchant ships were sighted. Instead, at 0552, two, and then four masts broke the horizon. Graf Spee went to action stations at 0600, and by 0610 her lookouts had correctly identified the newcomers: the heavy cruiser HMS Exeter, and the light cruisers HMS Ajax and HMAS Achilles. <br />\n<br />\nOutnumbered and with a speed disadvantage of seven knots, Graf Spee had no chance to outrun her opponents. Langsdorff turned his ship at the British cruisers, ran his ship up to 24 knots (the most it could do with a fouled bottom and bad engines), and engaged the enemy.

Destroyers were ships Graf Spee could not hope to outrun, but could easily destroy. More importantly, destroyers were used to escort convoys. The German lookouts soon corrected their mistake, identifying the heavy cruiser HMS Exeter at 0600, and correctly identifying two light cruisers by 0610. But Langsdorff continued the approach, knowing that he could not outrun, but did outgun, the British ships.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe British warships were under the command of Commodore Henry Harwood, along with a fourth ship under Harwood's command, were collectively known as Force G. Harwood had previously had his ships spread out to cover a wide area of the ocean: The light cruiser HMS Ajax watched the River Plate estuary, the light cruiser HMAS Achilles patrolled further north off Rio de Janeiro, while the heavy cruisers HMS Exeter and HMS Cumberland guarded the Falkland Islands to the South. Harwood flew his flag from the Ajax, to be closest to the center of the patrol areas.</span></span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt;\">\n<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"color: #3b491f; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; mso-ansi-language: EN;\"><span style=\"color: black;\"><br />\nHarwood had guessed right: soon after dawn his lookouts spotted smoke on the horizon, caused by Graf Spee's diesel engines, which were badly in need of overhaul.

Langsdorff's hopes of a surprise exit from harbor that night were gone. The German Captain met with his crew, which one officer recorded in his diary as being ready to follow their captain blindly, even to certain death.

There was a slim chance that the ship could make Buenos Aries without being destroyed, grounding in the channel, or being disabled by mud in the cooling system, but no guarantee that the government of Argentina would be any more willing to let Graf Spee stay past 24 hours than Uruguay had.&nbsp;</span></span><br />\n<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; mso-ansi-language: EN;\"><span style=\"color: black;\"><br /></span></span>\n<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; mso-ansi-language: EN;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">But then the whole discussion became pointless: as a final insurance against a surprise exit by the German warship, the British steamer SS Dunster Grange had sailed from Montevideo, again by Rothschild and Churchill pulling strings.

Just outside the breakwater, Tacoma stopped and transferred the German sailors to the Argentine tugs Gigante and Coloso, which had been hired out of Buenos Aries. The Uruguayan National Navy quickly turned Tacoma back into Montevideo where she would be interned for the duration for the war, as she had sailed without proper authorization and assisted in a hostile act. <br />\n<br />\nIn the south channel, just outside Uruguay's then three-mile territorial limit, Graf Spee swung west, turned out of the dredged channel, and dropped anchor. The timers on the charges were set for 20 minutes, and the order to abandon ship was given. Langsdorff and the last five officers hauled down the ship's ensigns, made sure the remaining crew was safely off, boarded the captain's launch, and moved about a mile away. <br />\n<br />\nJust before sunset, Graf Spee shuttered from the powerful explosion of the torpedo warhead in her engine room. A second later she was ripped apart in a tremendous explosion. Her rear turret was blown clear of the ship, the stern was severed, and flame belched high into the sky. The forward turret did not explode, probably because the initial explosion damaged the firing circuit.

A few ratings also escaped, and like the officers managed to return to Germany via a variety of routes, including through Japan and the Soviet Union. But the rest went to prisoner of war camps when Argentina joined the Allies in 1943. Six officers and 894 ratings were repatriated in February 1946, aboard the British liner Highland Monarch, fittingly enough escorted by HMS Ajax, while 168 chose to stay. Hundreds more returned, and some 500 of Graf Spee's crew eventually settled in Argentina.</span></span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt;\">\n<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; mso-ansi-language: EN;\"><span style=\"color: black;\"><br />\nLangsdorff enjoyed the company of his officers <span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>until about midnight.

Everyone has seen the horrific photos of dead and dying inmates taken at Bergen-Belsen, Nordhausen and other concentration camps when they were liberated by British and American forces in the final weeks of the war in Europe.

In the face of advancing Soviet forces, large numbers of Jews were evacuated during the final months of the war from eastern camps and ghettos to the remaining camps in western Germany. These camps quickly became terribly overcrowded, which severely hampered efforts to prevent the spread of epidemics. Furthermore, the breakdown of the German transportation system, as a result of the carpet bombing of the allied forces made it impossible to supply adequate food and medicine to the camps.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PR1rU0D6DLM/TsqcJmKbkaI/AAAAAAAAI9k/eQU8dUlSdZQ/s1600/ERT.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PR1rU0D6DLM/TsqcJmKbkaI/AAAAAAAAI9k/eQU8dUlSdZQ/s400/ERT.jpg\" width=\"419\" /></a></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"background: white; line-height: 150%; margin: 9pt 10.5pt 9pt 2.25pt;\">\n<span style=\"font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , &quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%;\">We are familiar with pictures of mounds of emaciated bodies piled high at some - not all - German internment camps.

Bernard Baruch, the American-Jewish banker agreed in an interview with F.D Roosevelt: <br />\n<br />\n\"If we keep prices down, there is no reason why we shouldn't get the customers from belligerent nations that they had had to drop because of the war. In that event Germany's barter system will be destroyed \u2013 <i>New York Times </i>14th September 1939. <br />\n<br />\nThe London Times stated that Germany's barter system made her an aggressor in the world market: \"One of the fundamental causes of this war has been the un-relaxing efforts of Germany since 1918 to secure wide enough foreign markets to straighten her finances at the very time when all her competitors were forced by their own debts to adopt exactly the same course. Continuous friction was inevitable.\" <br />\n<br />\nIn effect Germany was acting like the striking worker paying by credit card for over-priced goods from the company-owned shop. He now agrees only to barter his hours of labour for his sustenance. So there you have it. The war lobbying nations strangled by international debt; could not compete with a debt free National Socialist Germany, and so the German state had to be removed, indeed destroyed. <br />\n<br />\n\"Germany was trying to break the (high interest) credit ring of the money monopolists by the sheer force of economic sanity \u2013 and that was unforgivable\". In 1937 Hitler said: \"Germany will enter into no obligations to pay for her imports than she is capable of fulfilling. The German Government therefore takes the standpoint of the respectable merchant who keeps his orders in harmony with what he can pay. We have come to learn that the value of our currency lies in the productive capacity of our nation.\" (In other words, Germany wouldn't borrow on the high interest credit card. If it couldn't pay it wouldn't buy).<br />\n<br />\nThe world financial monopolists \u2013 the unseen gangsters behind the governments \u2013 were aghast. If Germany was allowed to succeed in her plans for economic penetration other nations would follow her example. The whole world would then exchange goods for goods on a basis of equality and friendship. No one would find the need to borrow and the financial period of debt (unearned wealth) from the apex of which Almighty Finance ruled the world, would collapse. Humanity from there on would be well fed with its natural resources diverted directly to its own people's mouths and needs. <br />\n<br />\nAt this point \"Statesmen began to prepare the public mind for war. No mention was made of the real causes of the crisis; the bitter scramble for world markets, the trickery and inhuman methods used to obtain spheres of influence and increase the world's mountain of debt and the power it wielded. <br />\n<br />\nOnce again, statesmen, many of them bribed, sacrificed the youth of their country on the bloody altar of Mammon. As in peace, so in war! The efforts \u2013 and even the lives of humanity must be sacrificed for a worthless economic system that's only 'value' was the power it gave to the few who controlled it. <o:p></o:p></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7os_-80sLxM/Tsqc9TIo7LI/AAAAAAAAI-U/NFkl-bsmYRg/s1600/imagesCATHL43D.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7os_-80sLxM/Tsqc9TIo7LI/AAAAAAAAI-U/NFkl-bsmYRg/s1600/imagesCATHL43D.jpg\" /></a></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\">\n<span style=\"font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , &quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%;\">One of the great ironies of the Second World War was that unlike Winston Churchill Adolf Hitler was not only empowered in a legitimate election but was overwhelmingly popular.

Defending On July 19th 1940 the German Leader rose to address the Reichstag in Berlin.

I consider myself in a position to make this appeal I am not the vanquished seeking favours but the victor speaking in the name of reason. I see no reason why this war must go on. I am grieved to think of the sacrifices which it will claim. I would like to avert them.\" <br />\n<br />\nHitler then declared that he was prepared to pull out of all these countries, and Czechoslovakia; all except those regions which were historically German and accepted as such under international law.

Typical courses might be astronomy, singing, literature, and naturally, learning the German language. Many returned to Blighty armed not with their rifle but with a degree from which their future lives and those of their families benefited. <br />\n<br />\nThe most high profile was Lord Mulley, M.P., Cabinet Member and former Defence Secretary.

The 31-year-old Budapest scholar, who was named \"military historian of the year\" in 1998 by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, identified additional misrepresentations in a scholarly article. <br />\n<br />\nIn an interview with a Berlin newspaper, Ungv\u00e1ry spoke of \"false photographs\" and \"false attributions.\" He said, \"90 percent of the exhibition must be altered.\" Perhaps ten percent of the exhibition's pictures showed German atrocities, he estimated, while another ten percent showed atrocities by Ukrainians, Finns, Hungarians or the Soviets. The remaining photos (about 80 percent of the total), he went on, showed no atrocities or crimes of any kind. <br />\n<br />\nOne of the exhibit's most often cited photographs purports to show a German army execution squad preparing to shoot several young men. In fact, as Ungv\u00e1ry established, this photo depicts a Hungarian firing squad in the town of Stari Becej (in Vojvodina, which at the time belonged to Hungary) in the fall of 1941. At the time there were no German troops in the area. The doomed men are Communists who had been sentenced to death by a Hungarian military court for treason, murder and sabotage. <br />\n<br />\nApart from its overt deceit by misrepresenting authentic photographs, the exhibition is a propagandistic fraud on a more fundamental level because it makes sweeping generalisations and fails to provide adequate historical context. A good example is the exhibit's most familiar photograph (reproduced on the front cover of Germany's leading news magazine, Der Spiegel), which shows German soldiers at an execution of several men in April 1941 in Panchevo, Serbia (Vojvoidina region).<o:p></o:p><br />\n<br /></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n</div>\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\nAs Budapest historian Ungv\u00e1ry says, \"I find this very worrisome, and it is unfortunate that no one does anything about this in Germany.\" The influential German daily The Frankfurter <i>Allgemeine Zeitung</i> newspaper wrote that the revelations highlighted the \"intellectual climate\" in today's Germany, which made possible a propagandistic enterprise with such prestigious backing. </div>\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<br /></div>\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\nOn another occasion the daily newspaper commented: \"The abundance of the exhibition organisers' errors, mistakes and negligence, proven by researchers, is devastating.

In a letter to his wife on 14th September 1945, he wrote: \"I am frankly opposed to this war criminal stuff. It is not cricket and it is Semitic. I am also opposed to sending POWs to work as slaves in foreign lands, where many will be starved to death.\" <br />\n<br />\nIn another letter to his wife he wrote: \"I have been to Frankfurt for a civil government conference. If what we are doing to the Germans is liberty, then give me death. I can't see how Americans can sink so low. It is Semitic, I am sure of it.\" <br />\n<br />\nIn his diary he noted: \"Today we received orders in which we were told to give the Jews special accommodation. If for Jews, why not Catholics, Mormons etc? We are also turning over to the French several hundred thousand prisoners of war to be used as slave labour in France. <br />\n<br />\nIt is amusing to recall that we fought the (American) Revolution in defence of the rights of man and the Civil War to abolish slavery and have now gone back on both principles.\" <br />\n<br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\" /></div>\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">\nEisenhower, at the end of his tether at the unmanageable General's utterances, relieved him of his position as Military Governor. Patton responded by saying he was not at all unhappy with his new assignment, because, \"I would like it much better than being a sort of executioner of a race in Europe.\" <br />\n<br />\nBy now a much embittered General Patton let his thoughts be known in a letter to Major General James G. Harbord, now back in the States. In it he bitterly condemned the Morgenthau policy (to dismember Germany, destroy its infrastructure and decimate its population). He also let it be known that he objected to Eisenhower weakly giving in to every Jewish demand, and the corruption, degradation and demoralisation of the U.S. Army, which these things were causing. </div>\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">\n<br />\nThe outspoken American General's fate was sealed when he concluded by writing: \"It is my present thought that when I finish this job, which will be around the first of the year, I shall resign and not retire, because if I retire I will have a gag in my mouth. I should not start a limited counter attack, which would be contrary to my military theories, but should wait until I can start an all out offensive.\" <br />\n<br />\nOn December 21st, a month before his planned resignation, the headstrong but suicidal foolish General was silenced forever when a truck 'accidentally' rammed his staff car. In some ways it could be regarded as redemption - for the havoc and misery the American forces had wreaked on war torn Europe. <o:p></o:p></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n</div>\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 12pt;\">\n\"Out of 3,000 people employed on the staff at the Nuremberg Courts (at which German captives were tried and sentenced) 2,400 were of the Jewish race.

I do not consider, given his physical condition, that it would have been possible for Mr Hess to have committed suicide in the manner later published by the Allied powers. He had neither the strength nor the mobility to place an electric flex around his neck, knot it and either hang or strangle himself. Mr Hess was so weak that he needed a special chair to help him stand up. </span></span></em></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;\">\n<br />\n<em><span style=\"color: blue;\"><span style=\"color: black; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">He was almost blind. If ever he fell to the ground he could not get up again. Most significantly, his hands were crippled with arthritis; he was not able, for example, to tie his shoelaces. &nbsp;I consider that he was incapable of the degree of manual dexterity necessary to manipulate the electric flex as suggested. </span></span></em></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;\">\n<br />\n<em><span style=\"color: blue;\"><span style=\"color: black; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Further, he was not capable of lifting his arms above his shoulders; it is therefore in my view not possible that he was able to attach the electric flex to the window catch from which he is alleged to have suspended himself.</span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><o:p></o:p></span></span></em></div>\n<em><span style=\"color: blue;\">  </span></em><br />\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;\">\n<em><span style=\"color: blue;\"><span style=\"color: black; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">Having regard to first Mr Hess' physical condition; second, the scene which I discovered in the summerhouse, in particular the location of the electric flex; and third, the surrounding circumstances as I have described them, I am firmly of the view that Mr Hess could not possibly have committed suicide as has been claimed.

The \"Agastya Samhita\" gives us Agastya`s descriptions of two types of aeroplanes. The first is a \"chchatra\" (umbrella or balloon) to be filled with hydrogen. The process of extracting hydrogen from water is described in elaborate detail and the use of electricity in achieving this is clearly stated. This was stated to be a primitive type of plane, useful only for escaping from a fort when the enemy had set fire to the jungle all around. Hence the name \"Agniyana\". The second type of aircraft mentioned is somewhat on the lines of the parachute. It could be opened and shut by operating chords. This aircraft has been described as \"vimanadvigunam\" i.e. of a lower order than the regular aeroplane.&nbsp;<br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\" />&nbsp;<br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\" /> </span></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%;\">Maharishi Bharadwaja is one of the Sapt Rishis and the guru of Dronacharya of Mahabharata , who lived in 4200 BC. <span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>Bharadwaja states that there are thirty-two secrets of the science of aeronautics. Of these some are astonishing and some indicate an advance even beyond our own times.

It is sometimes called the fifth Veda. The Mahabharata though not technically a revelation, is more than a revelation in the nature of its contents. For one thing it contains the greatest spiritual treasure ever known to the world, the <b><span style=\"color: #182c8a;\">Bhagavad Gita</span></b>, which may be rightly called the scripture of the world. This alone will suffice to make the epic the greatest work of the world. <o:p></o:p></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">\n</div>\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\nOn the surface it is just another story of a war between two rival sections of a dynasty, but its much more than that. It is the story of evolution of all life, it is a treatise on cosmogony, a code of universal ethics; it is also a history of the human race in its most general sense. All life is rooted in the One Life; the Devas, Rishis, men, beasts, flowers, rocks, why, everything in this manifested universe are all evolved in that One Life. There is a Great Plan in the mind of God (Ishwara Sankalpa) and everything that was, that is and that shall be, happens in accordance with that plan. Human free will is part of that Plan. <o:p></o:p></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">\n</div>\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\nThe Mahabharata is the story of the war for the throne between the virtuous Pandavas and their wicked cousins, the Kauravas. Symbolic of the struggle between the Good and the Evil, it recounts the inexorable rivalry between the two branches of the descendants of Bharata. A terrible war took place, in which kings from all over India and neighboring countries participated, opposing the one hundred Kauravas and their cruel chiefs to the five Pandava brothers, allies of Lord Krishna. For 18 days the battle raged with such violence that the heavens seemed to have disappeared behind a veil of flying arrows. The dead accumulated, the Kaurava leaders perished one after another. Thus the five brothers completed their earthly mission; only Yuddhisthira ascended the heaven alive but all others went there after death. An epic with a sad melancholy ending but softened by the Hindu notion of destiny.<o:p></o:p></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">\n</div>\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\nThe Mahabharata, <span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>the great fountain-head of Hinduism, is an account of its beliefs. It is, above all, a verse-chronicle of Krishna, the real hero of the epic, an incarnation of god Vishnu, whose divine nature reveals itself in magisterial interventions. There are hundreds of episodes which fruitfully soften the horror of the Kurukshetra war, full of charm, interposed as a form of digression; and they are based on high social ethics. <o:p></o:p></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">\n</div>\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\nBut the most admirable and notable is the Bhagavad Gita (the Song of the Lord).

Keeping Sikhandin in front of him, Arjuna attacked Bhishma. When Sikhandin's darts pierced his breast, sparks flew from the grandsire's eyes. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">For a moment the old warrior's anger rose like flaming fire and his eyes glared as if to consume Sikhandin.

These cannot be Sikhandin's, for they burn my flesh as the crab's young ones tear their mother's body.\" <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Thus did the grandsire look upon his dear pupil's arrows and, while saying this to Duhsasana, he took up a javelin and hurled it at Arjuna. Arjuna met it with three arrows which cut it to pieces even as it was speeding through the air. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Bhishma then decided to end the combat and made as if to dismount from his chariot, sword and shield in hand. But before he could do so, his shield was cut to pieces by Arjuna's arrows. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">With arrows sticking all over his body so thickly that there was not even an inch of intervening space, Bhishma fell headlong to the ground from his chariot. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">As he fell, the gods, who looked on from above, folded their hands in reverent salutation and a gentle breeze, laden with fragrance and cool raindrops, swept over the battlefield.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Thus fell the great and good Bhishma, the son of Ganga, who came on earth to hallow it and all it bears. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">The blameless hero who, unasked, made the great renunciation to give joy to his father. The undefeated bowman who had humbled the pride of Rama of the axe. The selfless worker for righteousness' sake, thus repaid his debt to Duryodhana, and lay wounded to death sanctifying with his life-blood the battlefield. As the grandsire fell, the hearts of the Kauravas also fell along with him.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Bhishma's body did not touch the ground, on account of the arrows sticking out all over his body. His body shone more brightly than ever before, as it lay as on a bed of honor, supported by the shafts that had pierced his flesh. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Both armies ceased fighting and all the warriors came running and crowded round the great hero, who lay on his bed of arrows. The kings of the earth stood with bowed heads round him, as the gods round Brahma.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">\"My head hangs down unsupported,\" said the grandsire. The princes who stood near, ran and brought cushions. The old warrior rejected them with a smile and, turning towards Arjuna said: \"Dear son Partha, give me a cushion befitting a warrior.\"<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">When Arjuna, whose arrows were just then burning the grandsire's flesh, heard those words addressed to him, he took three arrows from out of his quiver and so placed them that the grandsire's<b> </b>head found support on their points. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">\"Princes,\" said Bhishma addressing the assembled chiefs, \"Arjuna's arrows were indeed what my head required to be supported on.

Get me some drinking water.\" At once, Arjuna raised his bow, and drawing, it to the ear, shot a shaft down into the earth near the grandsire on his right side.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Upon the opening made by the arrow, there gushed a stream of pure sweet water to the very lips of the dying man. Ganga came up, says the poet, to quench her dear son's burning thirst. Bhishma drank and was happy.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">\"Duryodhana, may you be wise!\" said Bhishma, addressing the Kaurava prince. \"Did you see how Arjuna brought me water to quench my thirst? Who else in this world can do such a deed? Make peace with him without further delay. May the war cease with my exit. Listen to me, son, make peace with the Pandavas.\"<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">The grandsire's words did not please Duryodhana.

He moved about   destroying the Pandava forces like a fire burning up dry logs. His rapid   movements made the Pandava army feel as if Drona was everywhere at the same   time showering arrows like rain and converting the battlefield into a stage   for the dance of the God of Death. He cut the Pandava army in twain where   Dhrishtadyumna stood. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;\">\n<span style=\"color: black; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , &quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%;\">Many were the single combats among renowned warriors. There was   a fierce battle between Sahadeva and Sakuni skilled in illusion warfare. When   their chariots broke, they alighted on the ground. And, like two hills sprung   to life and motion, they struck each other with maces and closed with one   another in single combat. Between Bhima and Vivimsati there was a great   battle in which chariots were broken on both sides. Salya fought his nephew   Nakula and harassed him exceedingly, smiling most provokingly all the time.   But, in the end, Salya had his car smashed and his flag brought down, and he   withdrew admitting defeat. Between Kripacharya and Dhrishtaketu there was a   battle in which the latter was worsted. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;\">\n<span style=\"color: black; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , &quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%;\">So also was there fierce fighting between Satyaki and Kritavarma   and between Virata and Karna. Abhimanyu's valor was also demonstrated as he   fought Paurava, Kritavarma, Jayadratha and Salya single-handed and made them   withdraw. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;\">\n<span style=\"color: black; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , &quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%;\">Then there was a great combat between Salya and Bhimasena in   which Salya was defeated and made to retire. The Kaurava forces began to lose   courage and the Pandava army, who saw this, attacked the Kaurava army with   renewed energy and broke its ranks.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;\">\n<span style=\"color: black; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , &quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%;\">When Drona saw this, he decided to restore lost morale by   leading a straight attack on Yudhishthira. His golden chariot went forward,   drawn by four noble Sindhu horses, in the direction of Yudhishthira.   Yudhishthira answered with barbed arrows, feathered with eagle-feathers. But   Drona did not mind, and advanced at great speed. Yudhishthira's bow was cut down   and Drona was coming very near. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;\">\n<span style=\"color: black; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , &quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%;\">Dhrishtadyumna tried to intercept Drona but in vain. The whole   army shouted: \"Yudhishthira has been taken!\" So near came Drona.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;\">\n<span style=\"color: black; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , &quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%;\">Suddenly, then, Arjuna appeared on the battlefield, the earth   rumbling under the wheels of his chariot, as it coursed swiftly over the   bloody field, over bones and bodies lying in heaps. Drona held back, for   Arjuna had come on the scene. From his Gandiva bow issued a continuous stream   of arrows. No one could see the shafts taken out of the quiver or placed in   position. It seemed as if, from out of the great bow, an unending flood of   arrows issued without intermission. The battlefield was darkened by flying   missiles. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;\">\n<span style=\"color: black; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , &quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%;\">Drona retreated. Yudhishthira was not taken. The battle was   stopped for the day and the Kaurava forces went to their camp in chastened   mood. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;\">\n<span style=\"color: black; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , &quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%;\">The Pandava army marched proudly to camp and behind them walked   Kesava (Krishna) and Arjuna conversing.

If by some stratagem we could draw Arjuna away to some   other part of the field, I could pierce the Pandava formations and capture   Yudhishthira.

Having undertaken a war of adharma, he was often led to speak in this manner and hurt the feelings of the acharyas who stood loyally by him, even when they saw the wickedness of his ways. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Duhsasana roared in anger and exclaiming: \"This obstinate lad will perish now!\" led his chariot forward to attack Abhimanyu.

But Dhritarashtra's son-in-law Jayadratha, the gallant king of the Sindhus, swooped down upon the Pandavas with all his forces and enabled the breach in the formation to be effectively and solidly closed up, so that the Pandavas found it impossible to force their way in.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Yudhishthira hurled a javelin and cut Jayadratha's bow.

He attacked all the warriors around him and slew them in great number. Like rivers losing themselves in the ocean, the soldiers that went to attack him, disappeared before his arrows. The Kaurava army reeled under Abhimanyu's onslaughts. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Duryodhana's son Lakshmana, a gallant young warrior, then charged on Abhimanyu.

And what shall I say to Subhadra, quivering like a cow bereaved of her calf? How can I utter to them vain words of solace that serve no purpose? Truly, ambition destroys the understanding of men. Like the fool who, looking for honey, falls into a precipitous pit below and is destroyed, in my desire for victory I pushed to the battlefront this boy, whose life was all before him in love and joy.

These lives will multiply and soon their number will be beyond the capacity of the earth to bear. There seems to be no way of coping with this. This thought of Brahma grew into a flame which became bigger and bigger until it threatened to destroy all creation at once. Then Rudra came and pleaded for allaying this destructive fire. Brahma controlled the great fire and subdued it into the law that is known to mortals as Death. This law of the creator takes many forms, such as war or sickness or accident and keeps the balance between birth and death. Death is thus an inescapable law of existence, ordained for the good of the world. It is not true wisdom to be impatient with Death or to grieve immoderately for those who die. There is no reason to pity those who pass away. We may have reason indeed to grieve for those who remain.\" After saying these words of solace, Krishna Dwaipayana retired.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Dhananjaya and Krishna were proceeding towards their camp after defeating and slaying the samsaptakas.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">\"Govinda, I do not know why,\" said Arjuna, \"but my mind is not at ease.

This great deed of yours will please the hearts of your father and your uncle,' I said. The youthful hero did accordingly and broke the great formation and made his way in. We went behind him according to plan. But, just then, the wicked Jayadratha came and effectively stopped us. He caused the breach in the formation to be closed up at once and we found ourselves unable to follow Abhimanyu. The Sindhu kept us out, and then, Oh, shame on kshatriyas who could do this! A crowd of redoubtable warriors hemmed him in, thus isolated, and slew him.\"<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">When he heard the full story, Arjuna was again over whelmed by grief and he fell on the ground in a swoon.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">When he recovered, he took an oath: \"Before sunset tomorrow, I shall slay this Jayadratha who caused my son's death.

At one stage of this battle, Arjuna leaned on the flagstaff, dazed with the wounds he received. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">But Krishna spoke to him encouragingly and Arjuna recovered and resumed the fight, slaying the two brothers as well as their two sons who continued the struggle. Arjuna marched on and, killing many more warriors successfully made his way to Jayadratha.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<b><span style=\"color: black; text-transform: uppercase;\">Borrowed Armor</span></b><span style=\"color: black;\"><o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">WHEN Dhritarashtra heard Sanjaya relate the success of Arjuna, he exclaimed: \"Oh Sanjaya! When Janardana came to Hastinapura seeking a settlement, I told Duryodhana that it was a great opportunity and he must not lose it. I told him to make peace with his cousins. 'Kesava has come to do us a good turn. Do not disregard his advice,' I said. But Duryodhana heeded not. What Karna and Duhsasana said seemed to him better advice than mine. The Destroyer entered his mind and he sought his own ruin. Drona deprecated war, so also did Bhishma, Bhurisravas, Kripa and others. But my obstinate son would not listen. Impelled by inordinate ambition, he got entangled in anger and hatred, and invited this ruinous war.\"<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">To Dhritarashtra thus lamenting, Sanjaya said: \"Of what avail are your regrets now? The life-giving water has all run to waste and you now seek to stop the breach. Why did you not prevent the son of Kunti from gambling? Had you done the right thing then, all this great grief would have been stopped at the source. Even later, if you had been firm and stopped your son from his evil ways, this calamity could have been avoided. You saw the evil and yet, against your own sound judgment, you followed the foolish advice of Karna and Sakuni. Kesava, Yudhishthira and Drona do not respect you now as they did before. Vasudeva now knows that your rectitude is only hypocrisy. The Kauravas are now doing their utmost as warriors, but they are unequal to opposing the strength of Arjuna, Krishna, Satyaki and Bhima. Duryodhana has not spared himself. He is putting forth his utmost strength. It is not meet that you should now accuse him or his devoted soldiers.\"<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">\"Dear Sanjaya, I admit my dereliction of duty. What you say is right. No one can change the course of fate. Tell me what happened. Tell me all, be it ever so unpleasant,\" said the old king convulsed with grief. And obedient to the old king's behest, Sanjaya continued his narration. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Duryodhana was greatly agitated when he saw Arjuna's chariot proceeding triumphantly towards the Sindhu king. He rushed to Drona and complained bitterly:<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">\"Arjuna has effected a breach in the great army and has advanced to Jayadratha's position. Seeing our discomfiture, the warriors, protecting the Sindhu king, will surely lose heart. They had believed that it was impossible for Arjuna to get past you and that has now been falsified. He advanced before your eyes and nothing was done to prevent it. You seem indeed bent on helping the Pandavas. I am in great distress of mind. Sir, tell me, in what matter have I offended you? Why are you letting me down in this way? If I had known that you would do this, I should not have asked Jayadratha to stay here. It was a great mistake I committed in not letting him go, as he desired, back to his own country. If Arjuna attacks him, it is not possible for him to escape death. Forgive me. I am talking foolishly, distracted by grief. Do go in person yourself to save the Saindhava.\" <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">To this frantic appeal Drona made answer: \"King, I shall not take offence at your thoughtless and unworthy remarks. You are like a son to me. Aswatthama himself is not dearer! Do what I ask you. Take this coat of armor and, donning it, go and stop Arjuna. I cannot do so for my presence is necessary in this part of the field. See there, the clouds of arrows! The Pandava army is attacking us in great force. Yudhishthira is here unsupported by Arjuna and is this not just the opportunity we wanted? Our very plan has borne fruit and I must now take Yudhishthira prisoner and deliver him to you. I cannot give up this objective and run after Phalguna now. If I go after Arjuna now, our battle array will be hopelessly broken and we shall be lost. Let me put this armor on you. Go in confidence. Do not fear. You have valor, skill and experience. This coat will protect you against all weapons. It will not let any blow pass through your body. Go forth to battle, Duryodhana, in confidence as Indra did, clad in the armor given by Brahma. May victory be yours.\" Duryodhana's confidence was restored and, as the acharya directed, he went, dressed in magic armor and accompanied by a large force of soldiers, to attack Arjuna. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Arjuna had crossed the Kaurava army and gone far ahead towards where Jayadratha had been kept for safety. Seeing that the horses were somewhat fatigued, Krishna stopped the chariot and was about to unyoke the tired animals, when the brothers Vinda and Anuvinda came up suddenly and began to attack Arjuna. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">They were defeated and Arjuna scattered their forces and slew them both. After this, Krishna unyoked the chariot and let the horses roll in the mud. The horses rested for a while and were refreshed. Then, they proceeded again according to plan.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">\"Dhananjaya, look behind! There comes the foolhardy Duryodhana. What good luck! Long have you suppressed your anger, and now is the time for you to let yourself go. Here is the man who caused all this grief, delivering himself into your hands. But remember he is a great archer, well-versed in bow lore, and also a keen and strong-limbed fighter.\" Thus said Krishna and they halted to give battle to the Kaurava.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Duryodhana approached without fear. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">\"They say, Arjuna, that you have done acts of prowess. I have not seen this myself. Let me see if your courage and your skill are indeed as great as your reputation,\" said Duryodhana to Arjuna as he began to battle.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">The combat was fierce indeed and Krishna was surprised. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">\"Partha, I am astonished,\" said Krishna, \"How is it your arrows do not seem to hurt Duryodhana? This is the first time I see the shafts proceeding from the Gandiva bow strike their targets without effect. This is strange, Have your arms lost their power? Or has the Gandiva bow lost its quality? Why do your arrows strike Duryodhana and drop to the ground without piercing him? This is most puzzling.\" <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0M0k04sh4ZA/TsJlXy5_zaI/AAAAAAAAIhY/_fQCZrycDjI/s1600/imagesCAXB97RX.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0M0k04sh4ZA/TsJlXy5_zaI/AAAAAAAAIhY/_fQCZrycDjI/s1600/imagesCAXB97RX.jpg\" /></a></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Arjuna smiled and replied: \"I understand. This man has come dressed by Drona in charmed armor. The acharya has taught me the secret of this armor, but this man wears it as a bullock might do. You<b> </b>will see some fun now!\" <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Saying thus, Arjuna proceeded to shoot his arrows, first depriving Duryodhana of his horses, his charioteer and his car. Then, Arjuna broke his bow and disarmed him completely. There after he sent needle-eye darts which pierced just those parts of Duryodhana's body that were not covered by armor, until he could bear it no longer and turned and fled.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">When Duryodhana was thus discomfited, Krishna blew his conch and it sent a thrill of fear in Jayadratha's army. The warriors around the Sindhu king were surprised. They at once got ready in their chariots and Bhurisravas, Chala, Karna, Vrishasena, Kripa, Salya, Aswatthama and Jayadratha, eight of them, arrayed their forces against Arjuna. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<b><span style=\"color: black; text-transform: uppercase;\">Yudhishthira's Misgivings</span></b><span style=\"color: black;\"><o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">WHEN the Pandavas saw Duryodhana proceeding in the direction of Arjuna, they attacked the Kaurava army in force so as to hold Drona and prevent him from going to Jayadratha's rescue. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">So, Dhrishtadyumna led his forces repeatedly against Drona. As a result of all this, the Kaurava army had to fight on three fronts, and was greatly weakened.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Driving his chariot right against Drona's, Dhrishtadyumna attacked him violently. Drona's chestnut horses and the Panchala's dove-colored ones were entangled with one another and presented a picturesque sight like the clouds at sunset. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Dhrishtadyumna threw away his bow and, sword and shield in hand, he sprang upon Drona's chariot. Now standing on the shafts of the vehicle, now on the horses and now on the yoke, he attacked Drona bewilderingly, all the while seeming to scorch him with baleful and bloodshot eyes. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Long did this fight go on. Drona pulled his bow in great wrath and sent a shaft, which would have drunk the Panchala's life but for the unexpected intervention of Satyaki who sent an arrow and diverted the acharya's shaft. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Drona then turned and attacked Satyaki, which enabled the Panchala warriors to take Dhrishtadyumna away. Drona, hissing like a black cobra, his eyes red with anger, advanced on Satyaki who was among the front rank warriors on the Pandava side and who, when he saw Drona desiring battle, went forward to accept the challenge. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">\"Here is the man who, giving up his vocation as a brahmana has taken up the profession of fighting and is causing distress to the Pandavas,\" Satyaki said to his charioteer. \"This man is the principal cause of Duryodhana's arrogance.<b> </b>This man fancies himself a very great soldier and is ever bursting with conceit. I must teach him a lesson. Take the chariot up quickly.\"<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Satyaki's charioteer accordingly lashed the silver-white horses and took the car at a great pace. Satyaki and Drona shot shafts at one another so quick that they covered the sun, and the battlefield was in darkness for a while. The steel shafts swished glimmering like newly-sloughed snakes rushing about.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">The chariot hoods and the flagstaffs on both sides were battered down. Drona as well as Satyaki were bleeding profusely. The warriors on either side stood still watching the duel and they did not blow their conchs or raise their war cries or sound their lion-roars. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">The Devas, Vidyadharas, Gandharvas and Yakshas watched the great battle from above. Drona's bow was broken by a well-aimed shaft from Satyaki, and the son of Bharadwaja had to take another bow and, even as he strung it, Satyaki shot it down again. Drona took up another bow that too was shot down. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">And so it went on till Drona lost a hundred and one bows without being able to shoot an arrow. The great acharya said to himself: \"This man Satyaki is a warrior in the class of Sri Rama, Kartavirya, Dhananjaya and Bhishma,\"and was glad he had an opponent worthy of him. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">It was a craftsman's professional joy at skill displayed in the art he loved. For every specially-charged shaft that Drona sent, Satyaki had a ready answer of equivalent quality. Long did this equal combat continue. Drona of unrivalled skill in archery then resolved on killing Satyaki and sent the fire astra. But Satyaki saw this and, losing no time, sent the Varuna astra to counteract it.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">But now Satyaki's strength began to fail and, seeing this, the Kaurava warriors were glad and shouted in satisfaction. When Yudhishthira saw Satyaki was hard pressed, he told those nearby to go to Satyaki's relief. \"Our great and good hero Yuyudhana (Satyaki) is being overpowered by Drona. You should go there at once,\" he said to Dhrishtadyumna. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">\"The brahmana will otherwise slay Satyaki in a few minutes. Why are you hesitating? Go at once. Drona is playing with Satyaki as a cat plays with a bird. Satyaki is indeed in the paws of the Destroyer.\" Yudhishthira ordered the army to make a powerful attack on Drona. Satyaki was saved with difficulty. Just then, the sound of Krishna's conch was heard from the sector where Arjuna was fighting.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">\"O Satyaki, I hear Panchajanya,\" cried Yudhishthira; \"but the twang of Arjuna's bow does not accompany it. I fear Arjuna has been surrounded by Jayadratha's friends and is in danger. Arjuna is opposed by forces both in front of him and in<b> </b>his rear. He pierced the Kaurava ranks in the morning and he has not come back yet though the greater part of the day is gone. How is it that only Krishna's conch is heard? I fear Dhananjaya has been slain and therefore Krishna has taken up arms. Satyaki, there is nothing you cannot accomplish. Your bosom friend Arjuna, he, who taught you, is in mortal danger. Often has Arjuna spoken to me admiringly of your great skill and prowess. 'There is not another soldier like Satyaki,' he said to me when we were in the forest. Oh, look there! The dust is rising that side. I am certain Arjuna has been surrounded. Jayadratha is a powerful warrior, and there are many enemy warriors there helping him and resolved to die in defence of him. Go at once, Satyaki.\" Thus did Dharmaputra speak in great trepidation.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Satyaki, who was weary after his battle with Drona, replied: \"Faultless among men, I shall obey your command. What would I not do for Dhananjaya's sake? My life is the merest trifle in my eyes. If you order me, I am ready to fight the gods themselves. But allow me to put before you what the wise Vasudeva and Arjuna told me when they left. 'Until we return after slaying Jayadratha you should not leave Yudhishthira's side. Be vigilant in protecting him. We entrust this to you in confidence and go. There is only one warrior in the Kaurava army whom we fear, and he is Drona. You know his sworn intention. We go leaving Dharmaputra's safety in our hands.' Thus said Vasudeva and Arjuna to me when they went. Arjuna laid this trust on me, believing me fit for it. How can I disregard his command? Do not have any fear about Arjuna's safety. No one can defeat him. The Sindhu king and the others cannot cope with a sixteenth part of Arjuna. Dharmaputra, to whom shall I entrust your safety if I must go? I see no one here who can stand against Drona if he comes to seize you. Do not ask me to go. Consider well before you command me to leave.\" <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">\"Satyaki,\" replied Yudhishthira, \"I have thought over it. As I have weighed the danger against the need and I have concluded that you must go. You leave me with my full permission. Here is the powerful Bhima to look to my safety. There is Dhrishtadyumna also, and there are many others besides. There is no need to worry about me.\"<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"line-height: 150%; margin: 1em 0in;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">So saying, Yudhishthira placed a boxful of arrows and other weapons in Satyaki's chariot and got fresh horses yoked thereto and sent Satyaki uttering benedictions on him. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">\"Bhimasena, Yudhishthira is your charge.

Bhima then approached Drona himself. \"Stop,\" cried Drona. \"Here I am, your enemy. You cannot proceed further without defeating me. Your brother Arjuna went in with my consent. But I cannot let you go.\" Drona spoke thus believing that he would receive the same courtesy from Bhima as he did from Arjuna.

What code of conduct was it that permitted you to shoot your arrow at a man who was engaged in combat with another and could not so much as turn his eyes on you? You have done the deed of a low-bred fellow and foully besmirched your honor. You must have been instigated into it by the son of Vasudeva. It was not in your own nature to do it.

Or else everything seems to go on happily but suddenly things go wrong and terrible misfortune happens and the curtain drops. This is the art scheme of ordinary sensational stories. The Ramayana and the Mahabharata are quite a different kind of artistic creation. When we read them, our inner being is seized and cleansed, so to say, by being passed alternately through joys and sorrows, and we are finally lifted above both and taken to the Transcendent and Real. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-faRVSVNwQuo/TsM6FELBKRI/AAAAAAAAIng/dSs4AWuTq9w/s1600/imagesCAD4Y3E7.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-faRVSVNwQuo/TsM6FELBKRI/AAAAAAAAIng/dSs4AWuTq9w/s1600/imagesCAD4Y3E7.jpg\" /></a></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<b><span style=\"color: black; text-transform: uppercase;\">The Death Of Karna</span></b><span style=\"color: black;\"><o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">WHEN Drona died, the princes of the Kaurava army installed Karna as Generalissimo. Karna stood up in his gorgeous war chariot driven by Salya. The dauntless confidence of his bearing and his great renown as a warrior heartened the Kauravas. The battle again began. Readers of the stars were consulted and the Pandavas chose the propitious hour for grim battle. Arjuna led the attack on Karna, supported by Bhimasena immediately behind his chariot. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Duhsasana made a concentrated attack on Bhima and sent a shower of arrows at him. Bhima chuckled and said to himself. \"I have this wretch now safe in my hands. I shall today redeem my promise to Draupadi. Too long has my oath waited for performance.\"<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">As Bhima thus bethought himself of what Duhsasana had done to Draupadi, the anger within him blazed up uncontrollably and throwing down all his weapons, he jumped from his chariot and leapt upon Duhsasana like a tiger on its prey, hurled him down and broke his limbs.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">\"Wicked beast, is this the wretched hand that held Draupadi by the hair? Here, I tear out the root from your body. If there be any here wishing to help you, let him come forward and try!\"<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Glaring hatefully at Duryodhana as<b> </b>he roared this challenge, Bhimasena tore Duhsasana's arm out and threw the bleeding limb on the battlefield. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">And then he fulfilled the terrible oath he had taken thirteen years before. He sucked and drank the blood from his enemy's body like a beast of prey and danced on the bloody field, mad with passion. \"I have done it!\" he roared. \"The oath I swore against this great sinner has been redeemed. It only remains to redeem my oath as regards Duryodhana. The sacrificial fire is ready. Let that victim also prepare.\" <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">The scene made everyone shudder. Even great Karna was shaken as he saw Bhima in this ecstasy of wrath. \"Do not flinch,\" said Salya to Karna. \"It does not befit you to show any sign that may be mistaken for fear. When Duryodhana stands quivering in despair; it is not right that you also should lose heart. After the great Duhsasana's death, the army's hope rests solely on you. You must now bear the full burden. Like the gallant warrior you are, seek single combat with Arjuna, and win eternal glory on earth or the soldier's heaven!\" At these words, Karna recovered his courageous spirit. With eyes red with wrath and unshed tears, he bade Salya drive the chariot towards Arjuna. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">\"Enough of fighting,\" said Aswatthama addressing Duryodhana earnestly. \"Let us terminate this disastrous enmity. Beloved friend, make peace with the Pandavas. Stop the battle.\"<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">\"What? Did you not hear the words that the stubborn Bhima uttered when like a ravening beast, he drank human blood and danced over my brother's mangled body? What talk can there be now of peace? Why do you speak vain words!\" said Duryodhana. Saying thus, he ordered a fresh disposition of the forces, and gave the command for attack. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Then followed a great battle. The son of Surya sent a dazzling arrow, which spat fire and made for Arjuna, like a serpent with its flaming double-tongue out. Then Krishna, Arjuna's charioteer, at the nick of time, pressed the vehicle down five fingers deep in the mud, so that the serpent shaft just missed Partha's head but struck off his helmet! Arjuna was red with shame and anger and he fixed a dart on his bow to make an end of Karna. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">And Karna's fated hour was come, and as had been foretold, the left wheel of his chariot suddenly sank in the bloody mire. He jumped down on the ground to lift the wheel up from the mud.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">\"Wait a minute!\" he cried. \"My chariot has sunk in the ground. Great warrior as you are, and knowing dharma as you do, you would certainly not take unfair advantage of this accident. I shall presently set my car right and give you all the battle you want.\" <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BQmTHXV0v8Y/TsM6AXFnDUI/AAAAAAAAInY/eN1JJK4cklI/s1600/imagesCABNO0ZB.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BQmTHXV0v8Y/TsM6AXFnDUI/AAAAAAAAInY/eN1JJK4cklI/s1600/imagesCABNO0ZB.jpg\" /></a></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Arjuna hesitated. Karna was now somewhat perturbed on account of the mishap. He remembered the curse that had been pronounced on him, and again appealed to Arjuna's sense of honor.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Krishna intervened. \"Ha, Karna!\" be exclaimed, \"it is well that you too remember that there are things like fairplay and chivalry! Now that you are in difficulty, you remember them indeed. But when you and Duryodhana and Duhsasana and Sakuni dragged Draupadi to the Hall of Assembly and insulted her, how was it you forgot them utterly? You helped to inveigle Dharmaputra, who was fond of play but was unskilled at it, to gamble, and you cheated him. Where had your fairplay hidden itself then? Was it fairplay to refuse to give to Yudhishthira his kingdom when according to the pledge the twelve years of forest life and the thirteenth year incognito were duly completed? What had happened to the dharma you appeal for now? You conspired with the wicked men who sought to poison and kill Bhima. You acquiesced in the plot to burn the Pandavas alive when sleeping in the palace of wax into which they had been lured. What had happened to dharma all that time? What did dharma tell you when violent hands were laid on Draupadi and you were looking on enjoying the sight? Did you not then mock at her saying: 'Your husbands have left you unprotected, go and marry another husband'? The tongue that was not ashamed to utter those words now talks of chivalry. Chivalry indeed! When a mob of you surrounded the young Abhimanyu and shamelessly slew him, was that chivalry? Wicked man, do not talk now of chivalry and fairplay, for you have never honored them!\" <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">When Krishna was denouncing him in this manner in order to urge Arjuna to prompt action, Karna bent his head in shame and uttered<b> </b>not a word. Karna silently ascended the chariot leaving the wheel<b> </b>still stuck in the mud and took his bow and sent an arrow at Arjuna with unerring aim and such power<b> </b>that it stunned him for a moment. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Karna utilised the respite won, to jump down again and hurriedly tried to lift the chariot wheel up. But the curse was too strong for him and fortune had deserted the great warrior. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">The wheel would not budge, though he strove with all his great strength. Then he tried to recall the mantras of mighty astras he had learnt from Parasurama, but his memory failed in the hour of his need, even as Parasurama had foretold. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">\"Waste no more time, Arjuna,\" cried Madhava. \"Send your shaft and slay your wicked enemy.\" <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Arjuna's mind was wavering. His hand hesitated to do what was not chivalrous. But when Krishna said this, the poet says: \"Arjuna accepted this command of the Lord and sent an arrow which cut and severed the head of the Radheya.\" <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">The poet had not the heart to impute this act to Arjuna who was the embodiment of nobility. It was the Lord Krishna that incited Arjuna to kill Karna when he was vainly trying to raise his chariot out of the mud in which it had stuck. According to the code of honor and laws of war prevailing then, it was wholly wrong. Who could bear the responsibility for breaches of dharma except the Lord Himself? The lesson is that it is vanity to hope, through physical violence and war, to put down wrong. The battle for right, conducted through physical force leads to numerous wrongs and, in the net result, adharma increases. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<b><span style=\"color: black; text-transform: uppercase;\">Duryodhana</span></b><span style=\"color: black;\"><o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">WHEN Duryodhana beheld Karna's death, his grief knew no bounds. Kripacharya was deeply moved by Duryodhana's anguish of heart and said: \"Moved by ambition and greed we placed too great a burden on friends. They have uncomplainingly borne<b> </b>it and laid down their lives on the battlefield and attained the happy regions above. There is but one course left to you to make peace with the Pandavas. Do not, O King, any longer continue this ruinous fight.\"<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RKgeWpHAdSE/TsM58cbniuI/AAAAAAAAInQ/Y61r2t3vWjA/s1600/imagesCAB28T3M.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RKgeWpHAdSE/TsM58cbniuI/AAAAAAAAInQ/Y61r2t3vWjA/s1600/imagesCAB28T3M.jpg\" /></a></div>\n<br />\n<div class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"line-height: 150%; margin: 1em 0in;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Even at that moment of deep despair, Duryodhana did not relish this counsel. \"Perhaps, there was a time for that, but it is long past. What talk can there be of peace between the Pandavas and us with all this inexpiable blood between us, the blood of our dearest and theirs? If I surrender in order to escape death, how can I escape the contempt of the world? What happiness can I hope to have in a life so ignobly saved? And what joy can I hope to find in sovereignty, secured by a peace after my brothers and relatives have all been slain?\"<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">These words of Duryodhana were lustily cheered by the others. They supported his stand and they chose Salya and gave him the supreme command from then on. Salya was mighty of limb and as brave as any of the warriors who had been killed. The army was arrayed under his leadership and the battle raged fiercely. On the side of the Pandavas, Yudhishthira now led the attack personally against Salya. It astonished everyone to see how the man, who was till then the very incarnation of gentle ness, fought so furiously.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">The battle was equal for a long while, when Yudhishthira hurled at Salya, his spear that went straight and struck him. Like the great flagstaff at the end of a festive function, Salya's body lay lifeless on the field, crimson with blood. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">When Salya, the last of the great generals, fell dead, the Kaurava army lost all hope. The surviving sons of Dhritarashtra, however, joined together and attacked Bhima from all sides. He slew them all. The son of Vayu had nourished his burning anger for thirteen years from the time Draupadi was insulted in the Hall of Assembly. He said to himself now: \"I have not lived in vain, but Duryodhana still lives,\" and smiled grimly.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Sakuni led the attack on Sahadeva's division. After a while, Sahadeva discharged a sharp-edged sword-arrow saying: \"Fool, here is the reward for your great sin.\" It went straight and cut through Sakuni's neck like a sword. And the head, which was at the root of all the wicked deeds of the Kauravas, rolled on the ground. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Left leaderless, the wreck of the broken army scattered and fled in all directions, pursued and slaughtered to a man by the exulting victors. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">\"'Thus utterly was destroyed thine army of eleven Akshauhinis, O! Bharata, out of the thousands of kings, who espoused thy cause in their pride and might, only Duryodhana could be seen on that battlefield, fainting and sore wounded,\" said Sanjaya, describing the debacle to the blind king.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">After doing, in vain, all he could to rally his defeated army, Duryodhana, left almost alone, took up his mace and walked towards a pool of water. His whole frame was burning like fire, and water attracted him. \"The wise Vidura knew what would happen and he told us,\" he said to himself, as he entered the water.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Of what avail is wisdom that comes too late? What has been done must produce its result that has to be suffered. That is the law. Yudhishthira and his brothers arrived there in relentless, pursuit of their great enemy.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">\"Duryodhana!\" exclaimed Yudhishthira, \"after destroying family and tribe, would you yourself escape death by concealing yourself in this pond? Where is your pride now? Have you no shame? Come up and fight. A kshatriya by birth, do you shrink battle and death?\" <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Stung to the quick by these words, Duryodhana replied with dignity: \"I have not come here, Dharmaputra, a fugitive for my life. It was not fear that brought me here. I stepped into the water to cool the fire that is raging within me. I neither fear death nor wish to live, but why should I fight? The earth has now nothing left that I came to fight for! All those who stood by me have been slain. My desire for kingdom is gone. I leave the world to you without a rival. Enjoy it in undisputed sovereignty.\"<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Yudhishthira replied: \"Now, that is really generous, especially after you said you would not allow us even a needle-point of land. When we begged for peace and entreated you to give us a portion, you spurned our proposal. Now, you say we may take it all. It is not for kingdom or land that we fight. Must I recount all your sins? The wrongs you did us, and the outrage you perpetrated on Draupadi, cannot be expiated except with your life.\" <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Sanjaya, who related the events to the blind old king, here said: \"When your son Duryodhana heard these harsh and cruel words spoken by Dharmaputra, he at once rose from the water, mace in hand.\"<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Stepping out of the pool, the unfortunate Duryodhana said: \"Come, one by one, all of you, for I am single.

Did you not consent to many combining and attacking that boy, standing all alone amidst your crowd? Yes, when men face misfortune, they see and preach dharma and chivalry to others. Wear your coat of armor. Choose any of us you like and fight. Die and go to swarga or win and be king.\"<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Accordingly, the combat began between Bhima and Duryodhana. Sparks of fire flew when their maces clashed. Duryodhana and Bhima were equal in strength and skill, and the battle raged long, and the issue hung doubtful. Those, who stood watching, were debating as to whom would win. Krishna said to Arjuna that Bhima would redeem the oath he swore in the Hall of Assembly and smash Duryodhana's thighs. Bhima heard this and, at that moment, the memory of the great outrage came vividly to his mind. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">He leaped like a lion and came down with his mace on Duryodhana's thighs and broke them and Duryodhana fell heavily on the ground, wounded to death. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">Bhima jumped on the prostrate body of his enemy, stamped on his head with his heavy foot and danced a terrible dance.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"line-height: 150%;\">\n<span style=\"color: black;\">\"Cease, Bhima,\" cried Dharmaraja. \"You have paid off the debt.

All human joys, such joys as kings wish for in vain, and even Gods do not despise, have been mine, in their fullness. A warrior's death is the fitting crown of such a life. Dying, I go triumphantly to swarga to join my friends and my brothers who have gone there already and are waiting to welcome me. You remain here below, your objects defeated and yourselves the object of contempt of all kshatriyas. I do not mind Bhima putting his foot on my head as I lie helpless on the ground with legs broken.

They have been the victims of   insufferable wrongs at the hands of Duryodhana. When Draupadi was insulted in   the Assembly Hall, Bhima vowed: 'I will one day in battle break the two   thighs of Duryodhana with this mace and kill him.' He proclaimed this solemn   oath at that time and everyone has known it. It is the duty of a kshatriya to   fulfil the vow he has solemnly taken. Do not let your anger mislead you and   do not be unjust to the innocent Pandavas. You should, before condemning   Bhima, take into account all the wrongs that the Kauravas have done to the   Pandavas. Nothing but error can result if one proceeds to judge conduct   without taking into account the chain of events leading up to it. You cannot   snatch a particular act out of its context and proceed to give judgment on it   alone without gross injustice. The era of Kali has arrived, when the laws of   a previous age cannot apply. It was not wrong for Bhima to strike below the   navel an enemy who had wickedly contrived against his life on many occasions.   It was because of Duryodhana's foul instigation that Karna sent a shaft from   behind and broke Abhimanyu's bowstring when he was defending himself against   heavy odds. Arjuna's young son was attacked by numerous warriors who   surrounded him, when he stood all by himself in the field, deprived of bow   and chariot, and in a most cowardly manner, killed him. Duryodhana thought   evil and practised deception from the time of his birth and has brought about   the destruction of his people. There is no sin in Bhima killing this man.   Bhima bore the wrongs done and kept his wrath within himself for thirteen   long years. Duryodhana knew well that Bhima had sworn to break his thighs and   kill him. When he challenged the aggrieved Pandavas to battle, he knew very   well that he invited Bhima to make good his oath. How can you think that it   was wrong for Bhima to do this?\"</span><br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QB6_zE2Zo-o/TsM_tXxJrBI/AAAAAAAAItE/SZqsAr-ae84/s1600/imagesCAQRLS1W.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QB6_zE2Zo-o/TsM_tXxJrBI/AAAAAAAAItE/SZqsAr-ae84/s1600/imagesCAQRLS1W.jpg\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;\">\n<span style=\"color: black; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , &quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%;\">Krishna's words did not change Balarama's opinion, but his anger   subsided. \"Duryodhana will attain the happy regions reserved for the   brave.

In the assessment year 1983-84, Shanti Bhushan had filed an income tax return declaring a total income of Rs 2,15,520/-. This return was later revised and in that, he had claimed as expense a sum of Rs. 1,74,000/- incurred by him on coronary surgery performed on him in Houston, USA.<o:p></o:p></span></div><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;\">  </span><br />\n<div style=\"background: white; line-height: 18pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #353535; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9pt;\">Mr. Bhushan claimed waiver under Section 31 of the Income Tax Act (IT Act) which, inter-alia permits deduction of expenditure incurred on current repairs of plant. His stand was that a human heart is in the nature of a \u2018plant\u2019 and therefore the expenditure incurred by him on the coronary surgery was akin to expenses incurred on current repairs of a plant.<o:p></o:p></span></div><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;\">  </span><br />\n<div style=\"background: white; line-height: 18pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #353535; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9pt;\">The Assessing Officer rejected the claim under Section 31 and Section 37 of the I.T. Act. An appeal was filed before the Commissioner of Income Tax (CIT) against the order of the Assessing Officer. The CIT upheld the order of the Assessing Officer. Aggrieved by this, further appeal was filed before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) by Shanthi Bhushan.<o:p></o:p></span></div><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;\">  </span><br />\n<div style=\"background: white; line-height: 18pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #353535; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9pt;\">The Tribunal also rejected the claim under Section 31 relying on the test laid down by the Gujarat High Court in the case of CIT vs. Elecon Engineering Co. Ltd. (1974) 96 ITR 672 (Guj.). It said \u201cfor the expenses incurred on the repair of the plant to be allowed, the assessee would have to demonstrably show that the plant was used as a \u201ctool\u201d with which he carried out his business or professional activity.\u201d The Tribunal came to the conclusion that the assessee could not have demonstrated that heart was used as a \u201ctool of his trade\u201d since the heart was even otherwise an organ, essential for normal and healthy functioning of a human body, and not necessarily for a professional, such as a lawyer.<o:p></o:p></span></div><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;\">  </span><br />\n<div style=\"background: white; line-height: 18pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #353535; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9pt;\">An appeal was filed before the Delhi High Court, which was also rejected. The court held that \u201cFirstly if the heart of a human being, as in the case of the assessee, were to be considered a plant, it would necessarily mean that it is an asset which should have found a mention in the assessee\u2019s balance sheet of the previous year in issue, as also, in the earlier years. Apart from the fact that this is admittedly not so, the difficulty that the assessee would face in showing the same in his books of accounts would be of arriving at the cost of acquisition of such an asset. Therefore, in our view before expenses on repair of plant are admitted as a deduction, the plant would necessarily have to be reflected as an asset in the books of accounts. The second ground on which, we are persuaded by the counsel for the revenue not to accept the assessee\u2019s claim is that, even if one were to give the widest meaning to the word \u2018plant\u2019 under Section 31 of the IT Act, human heart would still not fall within the definition of the word plant.\u201d<o:p></o:p></span></div><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;\">  </span><br />\n<div style=\"background: white; line-height: 18pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #353535; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9pt;\">The Delhi High Court observed that \u201cthe question raised is the product of experience, deftness and obvious artfulness of the petitioner who is a seasoned, experienced and an eminent Advocate of the country.\u201d We will have to wait and watch if Shanthi Bhushan will prefer an appeal to the Apex Court against the Delhi HC\u2019s order. <o:p></o:p></span></div><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;\">  </span><br />\n<div style=\"background: white; line-height: 18pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #353535; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span style=\"color: blue;\">Mr. Bhushan WITH HIS <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">LYING HEART OF PLANT</span> is now part of Anna Hazare\u2019s gruesome foursome team.
