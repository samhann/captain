Just like how cattle behave just before a stampede. <br />\n<br />\nThe milling of an stadium audience is usually the signal that customary rules of courtesy toward performers are no longer applicable and that different forms of behaviour may be expected. There always lie within us certain antagonistic attitudes.

Muscles use ATP as an energy source. <br />\n<br />\nThe cardiovascular system is limited in its ability to quickly deliver blood and oxygen to the working muscles. Because of this, during high intensity exercise, ATP is also provided by anaerobic metabolism that don't require an ongoing supply of oxygen. Anaerobic pathways can provide ATP immediately, but they also have limited stores that need to be refilled after they are used up.<br />\n<br />\nATP is created in essentially two ways. One is by aerobic metabolism using oxygen carried in the bloodstream. This is a sure and steady way to create virtually unlimited sources of energy; however, it has a limit on how fast it can work.<br />\n<br />\nDuring intense power  exercise, such as fast 100 metres sprinting or  lifting heavy weights, muscles rely on anaerobic metabolism, which can only produce a certain amount of energy at a time, unlike the aerobic metabolism system, which can produce energy over hours like for a marathon runner .<br />\n<br />\nTrained marathon runners have a greater ability to quickly deliver oxygen to the working muscles which increases the ability to use aerobic metabolism at a higher exercise intensity. <br />\n<br />\nLactic acid is a product of anaerobic energy production. When you work out, you stress the fibers in your muscles, causing them to break down. As these muscle fibers break down, your body responds by processing the by-products of intense muscular exertion (a complex chemical and mitochondrial process), which is also referred to as muscular acidosis, or lactic acid build up in the muscle tissue. <br />\n<br />\nThis process is accompanied by an aching soreness, varying from mild discomfort to serious pain. You will most likely feel the most soreness (related to your body processing the lactic acid buildup in your recovering muscle fibers) the second and third day after an intense workout.<br />\n<br />\nVitamin C and potassium a Both nutrients are also believed to speed the recovery and repair the stressed muscle fibers. Vitamin C can be found in citrus juice and supplements. Potassium is found in bananas and kiwi. <br />\n<br />\nBy drinking plenty of water, you can flush your body of excess lactic acid. When you take the time to stretch after exercising, you allow the muscles to release some of the lactic acid building up in the muscles. After several workouts, you\u2019ll find your muscles suffer less and less from pain related to lactic acid build up. This is because the muscles adapt to the strain placed upon them.<br />\n<br />\nPain is a warning mechanism the threat of injury, to bodily tissues. <br />\n<br />\nLarge bulging muscles of wrestler is  a good example of cellular adaptation The normal muscle cell might have 2,000 myofilaments, the hypertrophied cell might have 4,000 myofilaments. The workload can now be divided evenly among twice as many myofilaments, and the muscle cell is capable of more work. <br />\n<br />\nThe new cells are more robust than their fragile cousins. The individual can do wrestling without excessive fatigue, and no cell injury results from the hard session. A new level of equilibrium has been achieved by the process of cellular hypertrophy. A wrestler with this type of muscular development can be considered to be in excellent physical condition.<br />\n<br />\nA large part of the loss of muscle mass with age is the result of disuse and atrophy rather than loss of muscle fibres. Muscles which are not used shrink at an alarming rate\u2014 disuse atrophy.<br />\n<br />\nThe greatest myth propagated by sport coaches is that lactic acid is the cause of the stiffness felt after an event such as a marathon. Stiffness is caused mostly to damage to the muscle, and not an accumulation of lactic acid or lactic acid crystals in the muscle. Lactic acid does not exist as an acid in the body: it exists in another form called \u201clactate\u201d, and it is this that is actually measured in the blood when \u201clactic acid\u201d concentration is determined. <br />\n<br />\nAnother misconception is that lactate is responsible for acidifying the blood, thereby causing fatigue. To the contrary, lactate is actually an important fuel that is used by the muscles during prolonged exercise. Lactate released from the muscle is converted in the liver to glucose, which is then used as an energy source. So rather than cause fatigue, it actually helps to delay a possible lowering of blood glucose concentration, a condition called hypoglycemia, and which will cause a runner to feel weak and fatigued if it occurs.<br />\n<br />\nMuscle cells convert glucose or glycogen to lactic acid. Then lactic acid is absorbed converted to a fuel by mitochondria in muscle cells.<br />\n<br />\nBy training at a high intensity (lactate threshold training) the body creates additional proteins that help absorb and convert lactic acid to energy. Thus when muscle is rebuild after a power isometric workout , the secreted hormone builds the muscles by redirecting fat from the abdomen area of men \u2013 butt for women.<br />\n<br />\nA kilo of waste fat requires 7000 calories. 300 calories is burnt in one hour of brisk walking. ( it is K calories !)<br />\n<br />\nBy sipping ice cold water every 20 minutes during the day you provide a clear repeated signal to your metabolism to keep your energy and alertness levels higher. When ice water reaches the stomach it stimulates increased energy production though out the body and raise alertness.  It also causes loss of excess body fat. One way to FOOL YOUR METABOLISM.<br />\n<br />\nHypertension is a drought management system of the body , where reverse osmosis takes place to refill the cells with water.

( Mindset: Cat \u2014 you are nothing but dust and ashes. Dog \u2014 for you the world was created.)<br />\n<br />\nRead on to get a handle of maturity. It is not what the whole world and management school whizkid tell you.<br />\n<br />\nA mature person lives according to the dictates of his own higher intelligence, not by whims and fancies. He does not have one foot in the past and one foot in the present to piss on the present. Right NOW\u2014 is the greatest moment of his life.<br />\n<br />\nHe knows the difference between what he cannot change and what he can. He knows what is his can never be taken away from him, while what has never been his will never stay with him.   <br />\n<br />\nHe knows that most people are neither for him nor against him-- they are thinking about themselves and the grind of life. He is aware that no matter what he does, some people aren\u2019t going to love him \u2013  <br />\n<br />\n-- a lesson that is at first troubling and then quite relaxing. He knows that there is good and bad in all people and in all things he will think in absolutes, and is able to be objective even when deeply stirred emotionally.  Thus the rate at which a person can mature is directly proportional to the embarrassment he can tolerate.<br />\n<br />\nA mature man does not engage in self-destructive behaviour, or burn up his energy in anxiety. He is not addicted to self pity and resentment. In a mature relationship, there is acceptance\u2014 there is no covert attempt to change or straitjacket the other. <br />\n<br />\nHe can enjoy the differences. For the foundation or a relationship is unconditional trust , transparency and freedom.<br />\n<br />\nMaturity is the ability to do a job without being supervised. The ability to bear an injustice without wanting to get even. It is the capacity to endure uncertainty. <br />\n<br />\nIt is the ability to laugh at yourself. The ability to think, speak and act within the framework of dignity \u2014 MATURITY, IS KNOWING WHEN TO BE IMMATURE AND DERIVE SOME HAPPINESS FOR YOURSELF AND THE OTHERS. ( is the policeman in the picture , immature? )<br />\n<br />\nHe can communicate freely and understand the others point of view. He can give unconditional love.<br />\n<br />\nIn proactive behavior there is a pause between stimulus and response ( not a knee jerk reaction )\u2014 for making a suitable choice of response. This does not mean he is hypocritic politician. He is truthful without being cruel and lives life with compassion.<br />\n<br />\nNo one can be a threat to a mature man as he is the fountainhead of his own solutions. A mature man believes in himself and he is not dying or craving for the approval or gratitude of others. <br />\n<br />\nHe does not care for success at the cost of his dignity and honour. He will not let criticism or public opinion upset him. When your CONSCIENCE dictates your life, no one else can.<br />\n<br />\nHe will say what he wants to\u2014 but in an appropriate manner. He will reject what others say\u2014 but in a logical manner. He will maintain his self respect\u2014 and respect others, who deserve his respect.<br />\n<br />\nA mature man knows that the difference between a loser and a winner is the difference in the readiness to learn and change, and not being bullheaded about it.. <br />\n<br />\nHe will avoid sarcasm, yelling, emotional outbursts when mistakes occur.<br />\n<br />\nA flexible person is always happier than a rigid one. Flexibility is a sign of life. Rigidity , its absence.<br />\n<br />\nA mature man knows the principles of dynamic risk assessment and can imagine the WCS ( worst case scenario ).<br />\n<br />\nWhen people talk about you behind your back, it confirms that you are important enough. No one kicks a dead dog. <br />\n<br />\nWhen you cannot forgive someone you are chained to him by hatred and bitterness. So when you forgive the wrong doer it is a perfectly selfish act.<br />\n<br />\nMature people have the ability to focus on important things.. They can resign with good grace whatever they are not.. the eye wont insist that it can hear. They will not allow yesterday to use too much of today.<br />\n<br />\nThere is no reality \u2014 only perception. It is up to you to perceive things the way you want to. <br />\n<br />\nStrike the right balance between effort and resignation . <br />\n<br />\nBe yourself. Get better at listening to your own drummer.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tugjD0mUn6M/TRWHC4ycNWI/AAAAAAAACXE/3P4S43PN51g/s1600/dark.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tugjD0mUn6M/TRWHC4ycNWI/AAAAAAAACXE/3P4S43PN51g/s1600/dark.JPG\" /></a></div><br />\nCAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL<br />\n..", "author": {"id": "14410812789424637654", "displayName": "Capt.

The ball starts off 7 feet higher than the ground .  No defender can position himself due to the flatness of the trajectory.<br />\n<br />\nThis strikes terror into the hearts of the goalkeeper and defenders. Delap has been the reason for 50% of  Stoke city\u2019s goals.<br />\n<br />\nNo coach in the world has been able to figure out his secret, which is threatening the football world.<br />\n<br />\nToday my 23 year old son soccer nut son was practicing the throw, with \u201c your truly\u201d  as the golden retriever.<br />\n<br />\nMy son has cracked the Delap code. He is not exactly dumb, as he is bound for Cornell University for doing his ME in Computer science. He has powerful shoulder muscles and tendons , as he works out at the gym.<br />\n<br />\nWhat he does is to take a 4 short and one long stride just before the throw, dig his front foot in, allow the mental ball of energy to flow from the ground to his right hand finger tips ( like in a Kung fu punch where the energy comes from the waist jerk ) <br />\n<br />\n-- and release the ball using his right hand to deliver a spin, with the left hand held in position only to legalise the throw.  The spin counters gravity and is accurate.<br />\n<br />\nNo slow motion camera can tell that this one handed throw is illegal\u2014because technically the left palm and right palm releases the ball together..<br />\n<br />\nInnovations can be best brought in by outsiders from the industry\u2014they are not hampered by silly rules and limitations\u2014they don\u2019t even know the existence of such a rule.  <br />\n<br />\nThis is why language translater Inter Milan  coach JOE MOURINHO  is successful.  Innovation has a lot to do with your ability to recognize unusual phenomena. If you cannot communicate you cannot innovate .<br />\n<br />\nI think of innovation as the \"best way\" skill. <br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><object width=\"320\" height=\"266\" class=\"BLOGGER-youtube-video\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\" data-thumbnail-src=\"http://2.gvt0.com/vi/8G4KZrIqHPI/0.jpg\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/8G4KZrIqHPI&fs=1&source=uds\" /><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\" /><embed width=\"320\" height=\"266\"  src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/8G4KZrIqHPI&fs=1&source=uds\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"></embed></object></div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><object width=\"320\" height=\"266\" class=\"BLOGGER-youtube-video\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\" data-thumbnail-src=\"http://3.gvt0.com/vi/R5zkA2kDRP8/0.jpg\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/R5zkA2kDRP8&fs=1&source=uds\" /><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\" /><embed width=\"320\" height=\"266\"  src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/R5zkA2kDRP8&fs=1&source=uds\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"></embed></object></div><br />\n<br />\nDo not hesitate to break virtually every rule, held sacred by conventional wisdom.

Bullfighting has been popular in Spain since the time of Emperor Claudius two thousand years ago.<br />\n<br />\nThousands of bulls die in the fiestas which take place across Spain , where there are no animal-protection laws. Different torture games are held like donkey chasing, Quail catapulting, and the nightmarish festival known as \"Toro Jubilo\" where the bull\u2019s horn are set on fire.<br />\n<br />\nThe bizarre \"Toro Jubilo\" is held in Soria, Spain. The bulls' horns tied with pitch rags are then set on fire, and the terrified animals are released to run madly through the streets\u2014are left to burn. For hours, the tar burns like a bonfire on the bulls' heads, scorching their faces, eyes, and bodies. <br />\n<br />\nMany burning bulls slip and crash into walls in agony and blind terror. The bull\u2019s tail is wrenched off and its testicles are mounted on a spear and paraded around by cheering crowds.<br />\n<br />\nTheir carcasses are later divided among the participants for consumption. The residents apparently believe that consuming the adrenaline laden flesh of the tortured animals confers fertility and invincibility. <br />\n<br />\nSpanish Greyhounds, the galgo is used by Spanish hunters to pursue and capture prey. They are by nature docile, gentle and affectionate dogs, yet the destiny of many thousands of galgos each year, once the hunting season ends, is to be ritually tortured and killed by the cruelest methods imaginable, for the entertainment of their owners.<br />\n<br />\nIn the 16th century, Catholic Spain was the great continental power. Spaniards were&nbsp;described by the rest of Europe as cruel barbarians, greedy, treacherous, ignorant, and narrow.<br />\n<br />\nIn South America where the National Language is Spanish, you hardly find any natives. In Portugese areas you can still find the original inhabitants. Under the pretext of introducing Native Americans to Christianity, the Spanish ruthlessly massacred native populations and enslaved them in some of the most cruel slave practices ever seen on the face of the earth.<br />\n<br />\nThe average Native American slave lasted less than a year under his Spanish masters. They held that Native Americans were only part human and so had no legal or spiritual privileges. <br />\n<br />\nBy the time the British took over Jamaica in 1655, the entire 100000 population of gentle native Arawaks , were decimated by the Castilian Spaniards. Towards the later stages these oppressed people decided that suicide was better than the ordeal of Spanish rule, and they poisoned their babies and killed themselves.<br />\n<br />\nThe gross disregard for human lives and bizarre sadism is characteristic of the Spanish Inquisition which killed 8 million people. In the 15th century King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella (under papal rule) acquired permission from the Catholic Church to target those people suspected of Muslim, Jewish or heretical beliefs to root out through the application of torture those who, although posing as devout Catholics, were secretly practicing religions considered non-conformist by the Catholic hierarchy. <br />\n<br />\nAs a direct result of this Papal permission and authorization the Spanish Inquisition was born. Thousands were paraded before pseudo courts to face the sadistic rulings of Inquisition judges. It was also used as an instrument of terror and torment against scientists, philosophers, and members of the Christian Church , who were believed to be irreverent toward the authority of the Catholic Church and its agencies. <br />\n<br />\nThere were a variety of sadist methods used by the agents of the Inquisition to force victims to \"confess\" to heresy or to sins or crimes against the Church. The rack and is perhaps the most infamous of all the torture implements used in this period.<br />\n<br />\nThe unfortunate victim was tied or strapped to a board by the wrists and ankles to two rollers. Then the rollers were turned in opposite directions, thus slowly stretching the victim until the limbs popped from their sockets or the body was broken. <br />\n<br />\nIt was noted that a person who refused to talk even under torture was being aided by the devil. While the poor victim was being tortured a clerk recorded what was said. They sprayed there instruments with so called holy water, wore amulets, herbs and crossed themselves in a bizarre manner.<br />\n<br />\nOther practices that were prevalent in the Middle Ages were to tear out the tongue. To blind the victim with sharp sticks or red-hot iron spikes. The pulling of the flesh with pliers. The skinning of the accused alive. Quartering (in which the victims intestines would be pulled from the body) and impaling, in which a stake would be hammered through the victim\u2019s body avoiding the vital organs, resulting in a slow death that could last for hours or days.<br />\n<br />\nA sharp iron fork was used to mangle breasts. Red hot pincers were used to tear off flesh. Red hot irons were inserted up vaginas and rectums. A device named the turcas was used to tear out fingernails. After the nails were ripped out needles were shoved in.&nbsp;Boots called bootikens were used to lacerate flesh and crush bone. <br />\n<br />\nThumbscrews were used to crush the fingers and toes. Acid was poured on victims and hands were immersed into pots of boiling oil and water. Eyes were gouged out by irons. Alcohol was poured on the head of the poor victim and set alight. Water was poured down the victims throat with a knotted cloth. The cloth was then jerked out tearing up the victims bowels.<br />\n<br />\nThere was no limit to the types and cruelty of the tortures. The inquisition meant anything was allowed. The inquisitors were sadistic and mentally disturbed. An \"Inquisition\" was supposed to be a legal inquiry by the church.<br />\n<br />\nOn June 30, 1680, in the area of Madrid, 51 outcasts were roasted alive in a orgy of torture that lasted 14 hours and was held as a grisly celebration to commemorate the marriage of Carlos II to Marie d\u2019 Orleans. The king himself gleefully set light to the first human bonfire.<br />\n<br />\nEven after the poor victims confessed to things they never did more torture was to follow. On the way to the stake or gallows victims were flogged, burned, branded and had their hands and tongues hacked off. <br />\n<br />\nBy the 17th century as the catholic church began to lose power the inquisition began to collapse. In 1870 the Papacy lost control of the Papal States and was left thankfully with only the territory of the Vatican City . <br />\n<br />\n8 million had died as a result of the inquisition, including men, women, children and babies.<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<object class=\"BLOGGER-youtube-video\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\" data-thumbnail-src=\"http://1.gvt0.com/vi/OYTuhqcA9mU/0.jpg\" height=\"266\" width=\"320\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/OYTuhqcA9mU&fs=1&source=uds\" /><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\" /><embed width=\"320\" height=\"266\"  src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/OYTuhqcA9mU&fs=1&source=uds\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"></embed></object></div>\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://youtu.be/YQLbbDHdOMw\">http://youtu.be/YQLbbDHdOMw</a><br />\n<br />\nClick on the link above-- a prayer for the dead and unknown souls.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_tugjD0mUn6M/TRWHLwH--DI/AAAAAAAACXI/g0-ubKb8LsE/s1600/dark.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_tugjD0mUn6M/TRWHLwH--DI/AAAAAAAACXI/g0-ubKb8LsE/s1600/dark.JPG\" /></a></div>\nCAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL<br />\n..</div>\n", "author": {"id": "14410812789424637654", "displayName": "Capt.
