There exists a strong belief that it is acceptable to deliver bad news to the company or raise personal concerns. <br />\n<br />\nOur mature ethics programmes have reduced voluminous codes of conduct to just a few sub core values like fairness, integrity, transparency, respect , tolerance for culture, responsibility , spirit of inclusion etc. Seminars are used to clarify ethics values , as sustaining an ethical culture is a continuous process without a finish line. <br />\n<br />\nWe trust our employees to do the right thing when confronted with a situation that provides no easy answers. We don\u2019t have yes-men who will not tell the truth to safeguard their jobs. We temper all technical judgments by the need to support and maintain human values. <br />\n<br />\nWe honour our contracts and don\u2019t cut corners. We do not allow conflicts of interest, which provide a competitive advantage to one client over another. We respect the intellectual property rights of our clients, and guard them zealously. <br />\n<br />\nWe do not advertise ourselves or our services in a deceptive manner, and will not misrepresent or allow the misrepresentation of the services by affiliates, associates, contractors, employees, partners and vendors. <br />\n<br />\nWe do not promote our own interest at the expense of the dignity of the marine profession. We obey the law in both letter and spirit. We maintain a safe and healthy working environment. <br />\n<br />\nWe do not encourage nepotism, fully aware that blood is a poor substitute for competence. <br />\n<br />\n##########<br />\n2) Innovation <br />\n<br />\nThere is something about innovation that quickens our collective hearts. We recognize there is no such thing as instant innovation. The farmer must invest in the soil before he reaps a rich harvest. We nurture a climate where innovation happens. <br />\n<br />\nInnovation at our neck of the woods is evolutionary not a revolutionary panic response to change . To innovate is not to reform, but to bring useful change. Changes need not be innovations but innovations are changes. Application of creativity is innovation. <br />\n<br />\nWe recognize that bureaucracy kills creativity. We encourage our people to use their imagination , listen to their their inner voice and use all their six senses to check assumptions and apply their creativity. We encourage creative dissent and we protect human feelings. <br />\n<br />\nWe brainstorm often to get feedback. We have a commitment not to allow our policies , procedures and rituals to get in the way of innovation.  We can sense the drift of change and ensure that we are aligned to it in advance as surely as a ship enters a narrow channel. We take change by hand before it takes us by the throat. We give recognition to creative thinkers and innovative doers . <br />\n<br />\nWe don\u2019t try to get our creative wild geese to fly in military formation. We recruit people who have the seeds of the future within them.  Innovate or die\u2014is our slogan . <br />\n<br />\nOur organisational gatekeepers frame the environment that enables innovation, however innovation is enacted \u2013 recognised, developed, applied and adopted \u2013 through individual employees.. <br />\n<br />\n##########<br />\n3) Dynamics <br />\n<br />\nWe have reinvented team dynamics . Our team is a dynamic whole based on interdependence rather than on similarity or cloning.  Our team acts in unity , almost like a single living organism, that requires to be nurtured to maintain its growth. We understand team chemistry\u2014the natural forces at play, to determine whether they are acting for ill or good and can make timely interventions to make the dynamics positive. <br />\n<br />\nOur people are harmonious team players and there is a natural force of inclusion which results in transparent communications. They inspire the highest level of commitment from each other. Everyone is accountable to one another. They share similar values, attitudes, ideals and goals . <br />\n<br />\nProper team dynamics ensures extraordinary results .Team dynamics consists of critical areas such as personal abilities, educational backgrounds, life experiences and personality compatibility of each exclusive teammate . <br />\n<br />\nOur HR department does TDP ( Team Dynamics Profiling ) to give us concrete indications on how the team will bond, interact and ultimately perform. Our seminars are basically team retreats where we enjoy our team rituals, chants and gleeful routines. <br />\n<br />\nWe encourage each person in the team to give both positive and negative feedback. We choose team players who will complement each other, rather than exclude each other, no matter what superstars they are.<br />\n<br />\nWhat we require is not well balanced individuals, rather individuals who balance well with each other . We devise strategies so that team players can feed off each other rather than cancelling out each other. Thus we remain united in our pursuit of our goals, resistant to disruptive forces. <br />\n<br />\nOur inspirational team leadership uses emotional impact. We afford an inspirational environment to our high performance teams . Communications in our Company is a group process, and mutual trust and respect are maintained in order to keep the channels open. No body's perfect , but we believe that our team is. <br />\n<br />\nOur team can produce a quality and quantity of work far higher than the sum of what the separate members could have ever produced on their own. Collective synergy of experience and expertise, accented with harmony, loyalty and camaraderie is indisputably our core asset. <br />\n<br />\n########<br />\n4) Compassion <br />\n<br />\nWe respect and appreciate culture in terms of itself. We are sensitive to cultural nuances . We listen and we respect local values . We think globally, but act locally. We understand that culture has a life of its own and is stronger than life and triumphs over death. We believe human beings have feelings unlike machines. <br />\n<br />\nOur human resources are not mere dehumanized code numbers or cheap labour to be exploited, thereby breeding indifference. They are our biggest assets. We recognize that people are not things and they need to be led and motivated rather than being managed.. When people do their jobs we get out of their way. <br />\n<br />\nWe recognise that our employees are bread winners at home. Our company can grow only if our employees grow.  We run a  innovative organization which relies more upon shared ethos, than adherence to hard written rules. We have people feel and our HR dept knows how to monitor the pulse of our employees. <br />\n<br />\nIf at all we criticize we do so in a constructive manner. We do not manipulate by unfair or insidious means. We assure the psychological, safety and social needs of our staff. No wonder our staff is eager to walk that extra mile to get things right\u2014 the XXXXX way. <br />\n<br />\nThese core values represent our  brand promise.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n####################<br />\n<br />\nCOMMENTS:<br />\n<br />\nI have worked for a lot of ignorant companies, who confuse goals with values. Their  collective noses are stuck forever in a knothole. They get their knickers in a twist when they are reminded that  --<br />\n<br />\n\"A goal is something you intend to accomplish. A value is something you believe in\" <br />\n<br />\nIt is better to keep away from such immature rubbish. <br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><object width=\"320\" height=\"266\" class=\"BLOGGER-youtube-video\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\" data-thumbnail-src=\"http://1.gvt0.com/vi/2UznXMCDH3k/0.jpg\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/2UznXMCDH3k&fs=1&source=uds\" /><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\" /><embed width=\"320\" height=\"266\"  src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/2UznXMCDH3k&fs=1&source=uds\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"></embed></object></div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tugjD0mUn6M/TRWGvlu-GHI/AAAAAAAACW8/180HQumxx5A/s1600/capt+ajit+vadakayil.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tugjD0mUn6M/TRWGvlu-GHI/AAAAAAAACW8/180HQumxx5A/s1600/capt+ajit+vadakayil.JPG\" /></a></div><br />\nCAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL <br />\n..</div>", "author": {"id": "14410812789424637654", "displayName": "Capt.

My children could have cow's milk only if they had to take oral antibiotics -- to form a protective sludge layer in their stomachs and intestines. But i would allow my children Yoghurt ( friendly bacteria ).<br />\n<br />\nA decade later, one of my friends excitedly rang me up and said Maneka Gandhi ( a minister ) had come on national DD TV , and said exactly what i have been saying -- THAT COWS' MILK IS TOXIC AND THAT NO ANIMAL DRINKS THE MILK OF ANY OTHER ANIMAL. <br />\n<br />\nEVEN THE COW DOES NOT ALLOW ITS OWN CALF TO DRINK MILK AFTER THE MANDATORY WEANING PERIOD OF 6 MONTHS IS OVER-- SHE JUST KICKS HER OWN CALF IF IT TRIES TO SUCKLE ON HER UDDER.<br />\n<br />\nCow releases milk only if she is fooled by taking her calf to it. In the west they suck it out forcefully using vacuum tubes , against the cow's wishes. The unhappy cow  will definitely release harmful chemicals into the milk, which will do the human drinker no good.<br />\n<br />\nPasteurized milk (UHT - ultra-heat temperature) causes the milk protein (casein) to change to an inorganic form, which cannot be assimilated by the human body.  This  protein cannot be broken down, and hence it weakens the immune system, causing allergies , asthma, higher blood cholesterol and increased risk of heart disease and stroke. Pasteurization also destroys enzymes,diminishes vitamin content and kills healthy beneficial bacteria. <br />\n<br />\nThe gooey mucus sticks on the inner wall of the intestines causes poor absorption of nutrients from your food. It causes constipation and can lead to many health problems, AS IT DAMAGES YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM.<br />\n<br />\nYes, cow's milk gives Calcium--but so does most of the other food you eat like brocolli, cabbage, nuts , sesame seeds, sea weeds, carrot etc. <br />\n<br />\nThe ideal calcium to magnesium ratio for the human body should be 2:1. Milk's ratio is 10:1. By relying on cow's milk for calcium, you will have magnesium deficiency and imbalance.<br />\n<br />\nFor infants, if breast milk is not available, due to the mother;s health ,  substitute with goat's milk instead on cows milk. Mahatma Gandhi used to carry a goat with him for fresh milk, as he felt it was good for his brain . Even when he went to see the Queen in England, he took the goat with him on the ship , pissing off the Queen's reception party at the gangway.<br />\n<br />\nUnlike the white man, Indians suffer from major lactose intolerance because we do not have the enzyme lactase that digests the milk sugar lactose . This causes gas in the intestines and a fuzzy brain. Methane fart gas is a global warming green house gas. <br />\n<br />\nMilk contains excessive calories and fats. Your sagging over the belt- beer belly , could be actually milk belly.<br />\n<br />\nCow's fart and belch ( methane gas ) is responsible for global warming. The cow lobby is so strong that nobody dares to rise a voice .<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"background-color: white; color: red; font-size: x-large;\"><b>A2 MILK OF HUMPED VEDIC COW IS NUTRITIOUS</b></span><br />\n<span style=\"background-color: white; color: red; font-size: x-large;\"><b><br /></b></span>\n<span style=\"background-color: white; color: red; font-size: x-large;\"><b><br /></b></span>\n<span style=\"background-color: white; color: red; font-size: x-large;\"><b>A1 MILK OF HUMPLESS JERSEY COW IS TOXIC</b></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_tugjD0mUn6M/TRWIcwa7cuI/AAAAAAAACXU/Md0YeST2UQM/s1600/dark.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_tugjD0mUn6M/TRWIcwa7cuI/AAAAAAAACXU/Md0YeST2UQM/s1600/dark.JPG\" /></a></div>\n<br />\nCAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL<br />\n..</div>\n", "author": {"id": "14410812789424637654", "displayName": "Capt.

Examples:-- Esters ( Acetates and Acrylates ) Pthalates  and certain halogenated compounds like Methylene chloride. <br />\n<br />\nHydrolysable cargoes must be carried in perfectly dry tanks with moisture content less than 100 ppm ( 200 ppm for zinc ). It is important to vent to eject aBsorbed/ aDsorbed  cargo in coating. This must be done prior doing tankcleaning with water.<br />\n<br />\nHowever certain viscous non-volatile products like DOP and Texanol  cannot be evaporated by venting and must be cleaned off by warm water immediately after discharge.<br />\n<br />\nHydrolysis :-- salt + water = acid + base<br />\n<br />\nSince epoxy coating absorbs cargo like a sponge , it means that two successive cargoes may require to be compatible with each other. For example after EDC if you load a cargo containing water, Hydrochloric acid will be formed which will destroy the epoxy coating. <br />\n<br />\nVinyl acetate monomer plus water gives Acetic acid. Chloroform plus water gives Formic acid. <br />\n<br />\nEsters can saponify in contact with water at higher temperatures resulting in increased short chain type FFA which can be aggressive to tank coatings. <br />\n<br />\nHydrolysis is a chemical process in which a molecule is cleaved into two parts by the addition of a molecule of water. This is distinct from a hydration reaction, in which water molecules are added to a substance, but no cleavage occurs.<br />\n<br />\nHydrolysis is an oxidation reaction between Chlorinated HC and residual water. Oxidation occurs due to exposure to radiation or the presence of certain catalysts and can be prevented by inhibitors. Hydrolysis is accelerated at higher temperatures.<br />\n<br />\nChlorinated carboxylic acids are very corrosive and not carried in SS tanks.<br />\n<br />\nAfter carriage of Hydrolyzable cargoes such as Acetates, the tanks should be ventilated to remove all traces of cargo before any water is introduced.<br />\n<br />\nThe breakdown of vegetable and animal oil fats to fatty acids is promoted by the presence of water particularly at higher temperatures. Hydrolysis is also promoted by the action of certain micro-organisms. Tanks in which the oil is being stored or shipped should always be clean and dry before use. <br />\n<br />\nChlorinated/ Brominated solvents hydrolyse in presence of water to form Organic and Inorganic acids which spoil the paint coating. Shippers must give the moisture content in PPM. Water content should not excced 100 ppm or 0.01% especially for epoxy.  Nitrogen pad is a must to exclude moisture.<br />\n<br />\nChlorinated solvents are slowly hydrolyzed to acids, SO ENSURE water tank cleaning is NOT stopped in an early stage.<br />\n<br />\n#######<br />\n<br />\nFREE FATTY ACIDS (IN VEG OILS AND ANIMAL FATS) --FFA <br />\n<br />\nFFA of certain heating veg and animal oil cargoes will increase if the moisture content is too high. <br />\n<br />\nVeg and animal oils have different SG at different levels after long storage. FFA of the layer closest to the coils increases faster and cause damage to the bottom\u2014 so recirc  Vegetable oil and Animal oil in coated cargo tanks. <br />\n<br />\nAdvantages are less manual labour for squeezing after discharge  and not allowing a difference in the FFA content between the lower and upper levels in the tanks. <br />\n<br />\nFat is combined with glycerine and fatty acid. When the fat is hot , it get decomposed to FFA and glycerine ( hydrolysis ). Increase of FFA means the cargo will become worse in quality. The quality of vegetable oils and animal fats is largely determined by their AV acid value. A fresh oil or fat has low AV. Parcels having different FFA shall not be commingled . Rapid heating results in increase in FFA content or discolouration of the cargo.<br />\n<br />\nVegetable oil and Animal oils have a FREE FATTY ACID content (FFA). The hydrolysis of edible fats and oils is promoted by the presence of water, particularly at higher temperatures. If hot prewashed FFA will increase rapidly to a level, which will coagulate the albumen in the Vegetable/Animal oil. This damages the surface of the zinc silicate lining.<br />\n<br />\nChanges in  quality  of  the  veg fats  and  oils  occur during shipment due to hydrolysis and oxidation , and this loss in quality is taken into account when edible fats and oils are processed further into food during refining.<br />\n<br />\nPrevious cargoes that are able to accelerate hydrolysis of edible fats and oils are:<br />\nacids and bases e.g. acetic acid, acetic anhydride, citric acid, fatty acids, phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, and sodium hydroxide solution.<br />\n<br />\nThe general loss of quality due to oxidation (increase in peroxide values) or hydrolysis (increase in free fatty acid [FFA] content) during a voyage can be eliminated by , nitrogen-blanketing the tank, especially if the cargo is refined oil to be used directly in the food-chain without re-refining.<br />\n<br />\nNormal values for refined oils in the Codex Standards indicative for oxidative or hydrolytic rancidity status are:<br />\nPeroxide value: up to 10 meq active oxygen/ Kg oil<br />\nAcid value/saponification value: up to 0.6 mg KOH/g oil.<br />\n<br />\nOxidation affects the colour and flavour (taste, odour) of the oil, producing oxidative rancidity. <br />\n<br />\nHydrolysis affects the flavour (taste, odour) and acidity of the oil, producing hydrolytical rancidity. <br />\n<br />\nAnalytical methods for hydrolysis are based on determination of the hydrolysis products.  Hydrolysis tests are based on the determination of the FFA content, humidity, acid value (or saponification value) or hydroxyl value. The acid value is the most widely used test method. Refined oils for domestic consumption are most susceptible to hydrolysis .<br />\n<br />\nThe Chief officer on a chemical tanker  must smell the tanks before they are loaded or unloaded and look into them during loading and unloading. Smell is a very sensitive sense. The purpose of deodorization is to reduce the level of free fatty acids and to remove odours, off-flavours and other volatile components, such as pesticides and light polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.   Deodorization of edible fats and oils is done by distillation.<br />\n<br />\nNeutralization ( alkali refining) is performed on edible fats and oils to reduce the content of free fatty acids and oxidation products of free fatty acid.<br />\n<br />\nFFA of veg/ animal oils attack zinc silicate paint which can cause zinc to shed contaminating cargo-- Zinc Silicate paint cannot take pH &lt; 6 . Recirc of veg/ animal oil in Zinc coated tank is a must to equalize the FFA content between the upper and lower layers. <br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tugjD0mUn6M/TQc7DLYHoFI/AAAAAAAAB40/60d6CixLcDA/s1600/capt+ajit+vadakayil.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tugjD0mUn6M/TQc7DLYHoFI/AAAAAAAAB40/60d6CixLcDA/s1600/capt+ajit+vadakayil.JPG\" /></a></div><br />\n-------CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL ( 28 YEARS IN COMMAND )", "author": {"id": "14410812789424637654", "displayName": "Capt.

A lub oil/ additive tank is normally 'upgraded' to methanol standard via two or three intermediate cargoes of aromatics.<br />\n<br />\nBut the method works if the previous cargo is soluble in toluene!!. Better check it out yourself with a sample in the ships lab.<br />\n<br />\nYou must have sufficient toluene on board. Toluene floats in water with a clear interface ( density 0.86) and is insoluble.<br />\n<br />\nThe ships course must be altered so that the wind is not blowing into the accommodation.<br />\n<br />\nSince it is the last resort it means that the tank is already clean and toluene floating is doing the final act. The ship must have no list and minimum trim. Rolling must not take place.<br />\n<br />\nPut enough toluene in the empty tank using the ships loading drop so that there will be a 10 cm interface. Make sure the hoses you use are resistant to toluene.<br />\n<br />\nNow introduce sea water into the tank via the sump or drop at 50 deg C. This temp is important to open the pores. Lift it up to the top of tank and then defloat. The water can be pumped out to sea. It is not safe to chase down the water with tankcleaning jets. Too much static is generated. After slow defloating the remaining toluene is transferred to next tank through a filter.<br />\n<br />\nThe toluene contact should be about 30 minutes. Then wash off with hot water injected with a surfactant. After the final hot wash , rinse with FW and steam.<br />\n<br />\nThe flotation method should only be used after first washing with cleaning chemicals. The method is then very effective, but it is less effective if cargo residues on the tank walls are of any appreciable thickness.<br />\n<br />\nThis flotation method might involve hazards as regards static electricity charges in the interface between the two liquids.

This super conducting resonator has mystical powers. Once the third eye is developed it is far more powerful than any of your 5 human senses. <br />\n<br />\nThough it is not part of the brain, the pineal gland develops from the roof of the diencephalon, a section of the brain, and functions as a light receptor. Darwin may not agree with me -- but, the pineal gland is the evolutionary forerunner of the modern eye. . This gland synthesizes melatonin and enzymes sensitive to diurnal light. Rhythmic changes in its activity in response to cyclical photic input shows that the gland serves as a biological clock. <br />\n<br />\nTo activate the 'third eye' and perceive higher dimensions, the pineal ( soul ) and the pituitary ( body ) glands must vibrate in YIN-YANG unison, to create a field , which is achieved through meditation, Mantra chanting ( cymatics )and Surya yog ( sun gazing.) <br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tugjD0mUn6M/TPE_mNjMJ4I/AAAAAAAAA9k/nQ_XrwMQrPk/s1600/imagesCAMN7ZXQ.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" ox=\"true\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tugjD0mUn6M/TPE_mNjMJ4I/AAAAAAAAA9k/nQ_XrwMQrPk/s1600/imagesCAMN7ZXQ.jpg\" /></a></div>\n<br />\nThe great Himalayan masters did surya yog by gazing at the rising sun with a silver coin placed in between the eyebrows on the forehead .<br />\n<br />\nThe solar wind at dawn, charging the earth\u2019s magnetic field, stimulates the pineal gland. This is the best time to meditate , chant and sun gaze.

It is located directly behind the eyes.<br />\n<br />\nThere are many who think that Pineal Gland is the only organ of the brain that does not come inpairs. However, under a microscope you can see that the pineal gland is divided into two fine hemispheres.<br />\n<br />\nThe nerves that serve the pineal gland don't originate in the brain but in the sympathetic nervous system. In adults, calcium make the pineal gland visible on X rays.<br />\n<br />\nIn Vedic times 10000 years ago, at the banks of the Sraswati river, the crystallised pineal gland of the great Masters was said to be the size of a lemon, and this with evolution, spiritual pollution and change in breathing patterns , has now been atrophied to the size of a small ground nut.<br />\n<br />\nIn Mahabharata war of 4000 BC, Sanjaya , with awakened Kundalini and 12 DNA strands , sits 5000 kms from the scene of battle and gives the blind King Dhritarashtra a blow by blow account.<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_tugjD0mUn6M/TPFA6NN3hyI/AAAAAAAAA9w/9QCvGLv9yG4/s1600/imagesCAJ68MB0.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" ox=\"true\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_tugjD0mUn6M/TPFA6NN3hyI/AAAAAAAAA9w/9QCvGLv9yG4/s320/imagesCAJ68MB0.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n<br />\nThis gland can be activated by activated by sunlight, and also by sound resonance.

Decline in melatonin is the trigger for the aging process, for Melatonin is the SUPER ANTIOXIDANT of nature. The hormone Melatonin, induces sleep, while Serotonin, keeps you happy and in a balanced mental state of mind. PROZAC raises serotonin. <br />\n<br />\nWhen the pineal gland does not receive sunlight, it secretes Melatonin, which induces sleep, increases blood sugar, craze for food, leading to obesity, fears and anxiety.<br />\n<br />\nThe pineal gland is a photosensitive organ and thus an important timekeeper for the human body.<br />\n<br />\nFor migrating birds, the pineal gland is the center for navigation. The pineal gland is a magneto receptor, capable of monitoring magnetic fields, and helping to align the body in space. Changing the direction of magnetic fields around the heads of birds alters their ability to orient. The pineal can generate its own magnetic field because it contains magnetite. This field can interact with the earth's magnetic field.<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tugjD0mUn6M/TPFB3RrDv8I/AAAAAAAAA94/QJ4vUBwXJQs/s1600/imagesCAPRO9DZ.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" ox=\"true\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tugjD0mUn6M/TPFB3RrDv8I/AAAAAAAAA94/QJ4vUBwXJQs/s1600/imagesCAPRO9DZ.jpg\" /></a></div>\n<br />\nElectromagnetic fields (EMF) suppress the activity of the pineal gland and reduce melatonin production. EMF activity therefore disrupts the bodies circadian rhythms. Cell phones, with their dangerous radiation fields, attack the pineal gland .<br />\n<br />\nThe pineal gland produces PINOLINE, ( 6-methoxy-tetra-dydro-beta carboline, or 6-MeO-THBC). Pinoline also resonates with the very pulse of life 7.83 Hertz, the pulse the DNA uses to replicate, and which has been measured to be emitted from the brains and hands of all successful healers, regardless of belief or faith.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tugjD0mUn6M/TQcZJRamddI/AAAAAAAAB18/ZYTkBQcV-xQ/s1600/tf4.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"236\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tugjD0mUn6M/TQcZJRamddI/AAAAAAAAB18/ZYTkBQcV-xQ/s400/tf4.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tugjD0mUn6M/TQcZM1L53-I/AAAAAAAAB2A/0KH7x0pk-Ig/s1600/tf2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tugjD0mUn6M/TQcZM1L53-I/AAAAAAAAB2A/0KH7x0pk-Ig/s1600/tf2.jpg\" /></a></div>\n<br />\nFlouride is a free radical scavenger and a antioxidant like melatonin . Being in the chemical field i can say for sure , it is a VERY DANGEROUS FOR YOUR PINEAL GLAND. It has an affinity to deposit on tissues rich in calcium .

White phosphoric acid is used in Coke, and does NOT corrode ship's stainless steel tanks. But if it has little bit of Flouride contaminant , it is used for fertilisers and it corrodes the ships stainless steel tank. Boiling water removes Chlorine, but concentrates Flouride. It can be removed only by reverse osmosis and NOT by ordinary filters. <br />\n<br />\nFluorine is not found by itself in nature, because it is so unstable that it chemically combines--violently, in many cases--with practically any other element. Fluorine has a natural affinity for calcium. Sodium fluoride, is a common ingredient in rat and cockroach poisons. Sodium fluoride rat poison rapidly alters the calcium metabolism of the body, rapidly destroys enzyme activity, and severely interferes with functions of the nerve channels.<br />\n<br />\nResonance can vibrate the pineal gland, to release seratonin, melatonin, DMT, etc. If you have a strong enough sense of conciousness you will taste a huge pituitary release in the back of your mouth and sinuses and throat, it is referred to as ambrosia ( amrit -- mental orgasm discharge ) . This is a result of DMT production .

When you move the dial on the radio to tune into a favorite station, you are arriving at the perfect resonance between its electronic circuit and the station's frequencies. <br />\n<br />\nWhen two vibrating systems are in resonance with each other, a rise in amplitude in the waves takes place. <br />\n<br />\nThe planet and the cosmos communicates with us in this primal language of frequencies.<br />\n<br />\nThe sacred hyperdimensional geometry of DMT via hadronic mechanics is the Sri Yantra -- the universal phase-conjugational force . Pineal DMT is the chemical messenger which links body and spirit. Pinoline enables the threshold levels of DMT to become active in the brain, but it requires an instant bungee jump induced adrenaline burst.

Together\nthey express the great void at absolute peace with itself. To activate the\nthird eye of Shiva, or to perceive higher dimensions, the pineal gland ( soul )\nand the pituitary glands ( body ) must vibrate in resonance to create a field.\nThis is represented by Samudra manthan in Hindu mythology, where mount meru is\nused to churn the oceans for Amrit or Ambrosia in a to and fro movement ,\nrepresenting vibrations.. The amrit of the ambrosia or Soma is the holy\ngrail.&nbsp; This is what the Templar knights\ngot after excavating King Solomon's temple. Soma is a divine LSD-- rather a\nmillion times more powerful DMT. A 12 strand Maharishi with NIL junk DNA can\nproduce it naturally, by resonating his pineal gland with his DNA, and achieve\ntelepathy and psychic teleportation. The psychedelic journeys are accessed and\nexperienced within the realms of the pineal gland. The pineal gland is the\nShiva lingam. Serotonin has the same chemical structure as this hallucinogenic\nsubstance Soma. Serotonin is transformed into melatonin only in the pineal\ngland. Decline in melatonin is the trigger for the aging process, for Melatonin\nis the super-oxidant of nature. The hormone Melatonin, induces sleep, while\nSerotonin, keeps you happy and in a balanced mental state of mind. PROZAC\nraises serotonin. The pineal gland produces Pinoline, (\n6-methoxy-tetra-dydro-beta carboline, or 6-MeO-THBC ) . Pinoline also resonates\nwith the very pulse of life 7.83 Hertz, the pulse the DNA uses to replicate,\nand which has been measured to be emitted from the brains and hands of all\nsuccessful healers, regardless of belief or faith. OM king mantra is 7.843\nhertz. Resonance can vibrate the pineal gland, to release Nuerotransmitter\nseratonin, melatonin, DMT, etc.&nbsp; If you\nhave a strong enough sense of consciousness you will taste a huge pituitary\nrelease in the back of your mouth and sinuses and throat, it is referred to as\nambrosia ( amrit -- mental orgasm discharge ) . This is a result of DMT\nproduction . DMT is the spirit molecule that bends space-time. Pineal DMT is\nthe chemical messenger which links body and spirit. Dimethyltryptamine, a\npsychedelic tryptamine Pinoline enables the threshold levels of DMT to become\nactive in the brain, but it requires an instant bungee jump induced adrenaline\nburst.&nbsp; DMT with Pinoline increases brain\nactivation multi fold. You cant observe the quantum world without your Pineal\ngland -- the other 5 senses have too narrow bandwidths. Quantum physics has\nshowed the ancient Indian Yogis were NOT mere dreamers of cosmic consciousness,\nwhere our bodies, our brain and its mind, as inextricably joined with other\nmatter and the mega dipole of universe . There is indeed a connection between\nconsciousness and tangled state quantum phenomena Indian Vedic maharishis had\nthe inherent ability to go on either side of the narrow band of five human\nsenses. THEY COULD TRANSCEND THE SENSES AND LIMITATION OF SPACE-TIME. They\nfirmly believed that the invisible below the quantum screen gives rise to the\nvisible. At the time of death Seratonin and Melatonin in the brain breaks down\nto Dimethyltryptamine or DMT, C12 N2 H16, just after the oxygen stops\ncirculating. This is the moment for the ultimate DMT trip. You see your whole\npast life as FRACTAL dvine geometry. When you consume Soma, colours , sounds\nand numbers all show up as fractal geometry. What you have learnt in the past\nis of no use to you. As you breathe in the oxygen enters your brain and causes\nan explosion of fractal colours. To the spiritual eastern mind, the story of\nSAMUDRA MANTHAN produces amazing acts of faith like the Kumbh Mela , which has\nbeen going on for 6000 years. Tamas and Rajas are conscious of each other. Amrit\nreveals the fractal nature of consciousness. Amrit is NOT external, it is\nproduced inside your head.&nbsp; All you need\nto know is how to produce it by your own mind. 12 strand DNA which ancient\nMaharishis had, has now degraded to 2 strand DNA. These 12 strand DNA\nmaharishis with raised Kundalinis , can read akashik records , convert them\nfrom fractal geometry, for daily life use. The cobra on Lord Shiva 's shoulders\nshows raised Kundalini and open third eye. This self realisation (of opening the\nthird eye) , is the ultimate goal of consciousness. <i><span style=\"color: blue;\">The timeless spiritual wisdom of the of the 7000 year old Vedas will\nroar to life after Dec 21st 2012- the veil of Maya or delusion over the third\neye will be ripped asunder\u2014as the first step towards upgrading the 2 strand 97%\njunk DNA to 12 strand nil junk DNA.. -- Capt Ajit Vadakayil</span><o:p></o:p></i></span></div>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3H4fE7RFsGs/TipzBG3Ax-I/AAAAAAAAEUU/ZJEPApi4hEQ/s1600/imagesCA55DPFG.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"344\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3H4fE7RFsGs/TipzBG3Ax-I/AAAAAAAAEUU/ZJEPApi4hEQ/s400/imagesCA55DPFG.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>\n<span style=\"color: blue;\">Grace and peace!</span><br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<object class=\"BLOGGER-youtube-video\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\" data-thumbnail-src=\"http://3.gvt0.com/vi/cIM69ePi2VM/0.jpg\" height=\"266\" width=\"320\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/cIM69ePi2VM&fs=1&source=uds\" /><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\" /><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed width=\"320\" height=\"266\"  src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/cIM69ePi2VM&fs=1&source=uds\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></div>\n<br />\n<br />\nCAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL<br />\n..</div>\n", "author": {"id": "14410812789424637654", "displayName": "Capt.

Most epoxies cannot take pH less than 3, though the manufacturer will NEVER declare this.<br />\n<br />\nThe pH scale is from zero to 14.<br />\n<br />\nNeutral fresh water pH is zero .  In pure water which is neutral, the conc of Hydrogen ion is 10 raised to -7 equivalent/litre which corresponds to pH of 7. <br />\n<br />\nZero pH is an acid of highest strength like Hydrochloric acid . pH 14 is a base of highest strength like Caustic .<br />\npH is a measure of hydrogen ion concentration in that solution. A small change in pH represents a large change in hydrogen ion concentration.  As the conc of H+ ions increase by 10 times, the value of pH decreases by one unit and vice versa. This is because the pH scale is logarithmic. This means each change of one in pH value is 10 times more acidic. <br />\n<br />\nSo a substance with pH 2 is 1000 times more acidic than one with pH 5.  In other words ( better to understand this well ) diluting a strong acid of pH 2 , ten times increase the pH value to pH 3.<br />\n<br />\nAcidic soil is infertile, so lime is added.  Thiobacillus ferro oxidans ( bacteria ) lowers pH to 2 or even 0.7.  Some lakes are fairly acidic ( pH 3.7 to 5.5 ). Be aware when a charterer while trying to save some money for TCFW tells you to dilute say molasses cargo with lake intake. Boiler feed water water cannot be acidic so additives are added to keep it basic.  <br />\n<br />\nNeutral or pure water has an equal conc of H+ ions and OH- ions. When an acid is added the conc of H+ ions become greater than that of OH- ions. Similarly when a base is added the conc of OH- ions increases while that of H+ decreases.  <br />\n<br />\nThus an acid solution is one in which H+ is greater than 10 raised to -7.<br />\n<br />\npH changes with temp. It decreases on heating. pH of boiling water is 6.56.<br />\n<br />\nThe pH of DI water drops from 7 to 5.5 due to some reaction in water when splashed  in air. Rain ph is 5.6 as CO2 dissolves to form carbonic acid. This is the reason why the DI water spray turns slightly acidic<br />\n<br />\nFew pH values:---<br />\n<br />\nHydrochloric acid/ 0<br />\nGastric stomach juice/ 1<br />\nCoca cola/ 2.5<br />\nOrange juice /3.0<br />\nTomato/ 4.1<br />\nBlack coffee/5<br />\nUrine/ 6<br />\nMilk/ 6.6<br />\nFresh water/ 7<br />\nBlood/ 7.4<br />\nSea water/ 8<br />\nTooth paste/ 9.9<br />\nAmmonia/ 11.9<br />\nCaustic/ 14<br />\n<br />\nPrior loading certain cargoes the pH value of the tank internals and attachments are taken to make sure they are neutral ( Phenol ).<br />\n<br />\nCanned food is sterilized by lowering pH using acidulants like citric, acetic, fumaric, ascorbic, propionic, lactic, adipic, tartaric etc.<br />\n<br />\npH in water at room temp 25C-- there is only one hydrogen ion for every 555 million water molecules. Basically ph scale measures the amount of H+ and OH-. <br />\n<br />\nA person cannot survive if his blood ph drops to 7 or rises to 7.8. The buffering capacity of blood prevents such swings in pH level. <br />\n<br />\nThe gentleman who invented pH wanted to know how acidic his beer was. Beer needs yeast and yeast uses enzymes. Enzymes work only if pH is right. Beer is pH3<br />\n<br />\nFor the erudite\u2014  The pH of a solution depends on the concentration of ionized protons and not the total concentration  of acid.  If there is an excess of protons it is an acidic solution. If there is a shortage of protons it is basic. <br />\n<br />\nBufferclean 5.5 removes all zinc white salts and brings it down like snow fall.  <br />\n<br />\nBuffer solution resists any change of its pH value due to dilution or an addition of solution of acid/ alkali. The process by which H+ or OH- ions are removed so that pH remains constant is known as buffer action.<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><i>Digression:</i></span><br />\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><i><br />\n</i></span><br />\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><i>Once i joined a chemical tankers with zinc silicate coating, with zinc shedding-- and coating permanently destroyed.
